out)</p>\n<p>why not head over and leave them a comment to let them know the good news!</p>\n<h2>[Transcript]</h2>\n<p>Hey and welcome to another newsletter.</p>\n<p>Well I am moving this time because last time I was spinning around in circles and people didn’t like that and to be honest when I looked back on the video it made me a bit dizzy as well.</p>\n<p>And it’s okay. Now I am moving and I am right over there. It’s not as nice weather today, but it doesn’t matter because I spent most of the time in front of the computer this week because I will be putting into practice all of those things that I have been learning on the course that I have been doing, you know I told you about that last week.</p>\n<p>And, I programmed the thing, coded it, it was only a little bit of code for the new system for registering and when people register it will put their password as their user name and then when they log in they will get promoted to changed their password to a more secure and less easy to remember and stuff like that. That has been coded and I have tested that and it’s working so I will put it in over this week and this weekend to make sure that it works properly and then when the news comes in that’s sorted. Brilliant.</p>\n<p>But talking about new users. Since I had the sale when the sale ended I haven’t had any sales for like 14 days!.</p>\n<p>That’s the longest it’s ever gone, ever in the entire history of the business of Commentluv. Now I put that down to something that I’ve changed during that time and one of those is the sales video and the other one is that’s it’s on a new system.</p>\n<p>There might have been a little friction with people getting a little confused or whatever and like that. I’ve switched it back to the original video and I committed myself to making another video that is similar to that one more modern, more up to date with the things you can do with the anti-spam measures and things like that.</p>\n<p>So that’s nice, I’ve got loads more work to do for that kind of situation and well you’re probably used to on this types of newsletters  and things that people talk about their products. You are used to people saying “oh it sells like hot cakes”, It’s always selling, it’s always selling. So maybe they are not being completely transparent with things when sales aren’t happening.</p>\n<p>The whole point of these newsletters is that you could learn from my mistakes. Especially lately I’ve made lots of mistakes! , loads, and you won’t have to spend lots of money learning stuff the hard way and you can do it the easy way for me doing it. You know I hope that’s okay and  it’ll have to be because that’s how it’s going to be.</p>\n<p>All right, now I’ve told you about the coded thing about the user names and password and that’s all sorted. I’ve told you about the sales and things like that. The sales video having to go back to the old one because apparently the new one that I made that I thought was really awesome; isn’t. You know but when in sales always be testing. If you are just going to switch it on and leave it and then you are going to ask for trouble anyways. So it’s all well and good. It’s all fair and good. Fair and safe here in business and plug-ins.</p>\n<p>And also if you remember last week or the week before I asked what was your favorite plug-in or premium or your go to premium plug-in. Something that you always install and when you create a new site and stuff like that. I am still interested to hear about that, and you can let me know with the link in this post and/ or you could just reply to an email, this email, this newsletter email. And let me know which is your favorite premium plug-in. What one is the best and if you’ve got time you can also tell me why that’s the one that you chose. And that will really help me with some of my research that I am doing that’s applying to the stuff that I’ve learned in the course that I did from the money I got from the sales.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t a complete failure. I did make some decent sales, but you know I couldn’t really hope for more because I didn’t do any kind of lead up to it. You can’t just send an email to your own internal list and expect miracles to happen and I really didn’t expect miracles to happen. It would have been nice if it had but whatever I don’t mind this is the way business goes. Sometimes it’s good sometimes it’s bad. And, if it’s bad then you do stuff  to it and you tweak things and keep changing stuff until everything is good and then you become bankrupt, but there is no chance of that because I don’t have loads of property and staff and another extraneous expenses for this plug-in. It’s just the plugin and the hosting , and the hosting and the graphics or advertisements and the affiliates and the other stuff for that. So not really that much to worry about.</p>\n<p>Okay, so that is me and that is good bye, and I was trying to say it at the same time. Okay so let me know by replying to this newsletter what your favorite premium plug in is and / or you can do the survey form and you can fill it in there, but if you put in this email address then for sure you will get entered into the contest to win $50, which I think is fair enough. I’ll pay you to tell me what you want to use.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://comluv.com/bol-newsletter-57-contes-sales-dissapointment-new-plugin-coded/\">BOL Newsletter #57 &#8211; Contest , Sales dissapointment and New plugin coded</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://comluv.com\">ComLuv</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"andy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"http://comluv.com/bol-newsletter-57-contes-sales-dissapointment-new-plugin-coded/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"BOL Newsletter #56 –  launch finished and new direction in 4k\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"http://comluv.com/sales-launched-finished-new-direction/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"http://comluv.com/sales-launched-finished-new-direction/#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Jun 2014 14:00:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Newsletter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Andy bailey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"commentluv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"contest\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"coupon\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"sales video\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"http://comluv.wpengine.com/?p=25676\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6081:\"<p>Here&#8217;s the video and transcription of this weeks newsletter</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gpm9TAp8wLI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Here is the link Trello that I&#8217;d like for you to use, join up for free and get me a free month of gold!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://trello.com/andybailey5/recommend\">Join Trello here</a></p>\n<h2>Contest Winner</h2>\n<p>And this weeks winner is Julie from <a href=\"http://businessamongmoms.com/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Business Among Moms</span></a>, who recently wrote about <a href=\"http://businessamongmoms.com/blog/2012/04/17/bam-ways-get-involved/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">New to BAM?

Well, it did okay actually. Did I get enough to get a new video editing suite? Well unfortunately, no. I think I was trying to be a little bit cheeky there to get extra stuff out of this sale, but that wasn&#8217;t the point to having this sale.</p>\n<p>The whole point was to see which direction Commentluv needs to go in now, and highlight what things I need to work on, and what things need work, and work through the funnel, and what kind of settings that need tweaking and adapting so that we can go to a new era of the way Commentluv works.</p>\n<p>Now one of the first things I noticed was the password and the access system that go in through Zaxaa. You get a user name and password for Zaxaa, but then you get another one for Commentluv and how to download the plug-in and all sorts of stuff like that. Now that is okay. Most people got through it okay and they were able to determine what their user name and password is from which email and stuff, but you know even though there is nothing wrong with it I will do something to change that.</p>\n<p>So my idea is to let everyone have an initial username and password of their email address and that&#8217;s the address that they set up through Zaxaa or through their PayPal or whichever one they use their preferred one that they ask for at the beginning.</p>\n<p>I will set the username and password to those. Both are the same thing as their email address and that way they could log in. And, as soon as they log in it promotes them to change their password to something else.</p>\n<p>And, this way they don’t have to wait for emails to come through from my server or if there is some network interruptions. So that will be that sorted as soon as they log in they change their password and everything is hunky dory and they don&#8217;t need to wait for anyone before they can log in and go to the members area. Pretty sweet.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also got some funnel enhancements as well, but luckily it did make a fair few sales. Not as many as I was expecting on the fantastic pipe dream, day dream of thing I had in my head. I would be brilliant if they made 10 squillion dollars. It didn&#8217;t make 10 squillion, but it did make enough. More than enough to pay for the email series that I&#8217;ll be having for new members when they come in and existing members will be able to see how they can get that as well.</p>\n<p>And also, I had enough money to get this course that is being released today about Facebook advertising about identifying audiences and stuff like that. It&#8217;s a good guide and the course is done by a guy. The last course I did with him I made over $50,000 from the results of it. So you know it&#8217;s worth having a go at this one as well, and I think investing some money back into the business which is basically me is a good idea because that way when I do go forward with Commentluv then I&#8217;ll know I am going in the right direction rather than just driving off into oblivion and hoping, &#8211;hoping and crossing my fingers and hoping that it will work. So that does seem like a plan.</p>\n<p>The sale is going to end today. It didn’t make 10 squillion dollars but it did make a few thousand and so I will be able to use that money wisely. I am not going to spend it on ivory back scratchers!, I am going to go invest it on myself and get some course material and learn how to do something’s and stuff that really needs to be learnt how to do so that then I can do it properly rather than just you know throwing loads of stuff into the breeze and which ones lands.</p>\n<p>You know, it&#8217;s not going to be like that anymore.</p>\n<p>Okay so it was really nice to catch up with you. I haven&#8217;t been in your inbox for a couple of weeks while I&#8217;ve been doing the launch or the little money off thing and the little direction seeker that I have been doing with the launch, and I will be coming back into your inbox now, from now on and on a weekly basis it should be. And, hopefully this video is in ultra HD. I don&#8217;t know why I set it to ultra HD, what are going to do? If you can might as well do it!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://comluv.com/sales-launched-finished-new-direction/\">BOL Newsletter #56 &#8211;  launch finished and new direction in 4k</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://comluv.com\">ComLuv</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"andy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"http://comluv.com/sales-launched-finished-new-direction/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"Sick and tired of losing your computer and cell phone data?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"http://comluv.com/sick-tired-losing-computer-cell-phone-data/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"http://comluv.com/sick-tired-losing-computer-cell-phone-data/#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 15 Jun 2014 06:51:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Newsletter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"backup\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"cloud\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"storage\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"http://comluv.wpengine.com/?p=25570\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3544:\"<p><img src=\"http://comluv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drivepo-p-300x170.png\" alt=\"drivepo-p\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-25571\" /><br />\nAs you know, I get pinged all the time by vendors who would like to share helpful tools and products that will make your blogging easier.</p>\n<p>My friend Rob at DrivePop is a kind sponsor of this newsletter and his company is having a cloud storage fathers day sale.</p>\n<p>Because losing your files is way more common than you&#8217;d think, you should probably have a backup solution.

The first thing is who won the subject that I asked about you remember with the email, I said what would you like to be taught when you were a beginner blogger and I will get the right to who is getting paid thousands of dollars to write stuff about that.</p>\n<p>And I said whoever gives me the best suggestion gets $100. I made the thing right then and there on the video, but these subjects have been sent over to the writer and I’ve got a winner of the suggestions and I will show you those suggestions in a couple of videos time when I explain who won and how they won and what they are going to win.</p>\n<p>And the other thing I want to say is for my birthday on the 12<sup>th</sup> of June I am going to have an extravaganza that is not too extravagant because you know I am sick!</p>\n<p>So what we are going to have is we are going to have some way of helping me get a new video editing suite, and I really need one because the old one is just too old now.</p>\n<p>Its old hardware, old software and I want to get a new one. And so, what I can do is I am going to use this as a litmus test to see where Commentluv is going to go.</p>\n<p>And also If I get a new video editing suite oh it would be so sweet to get a suite and be able to make loads more of extra tutorial videos  just for Commentluv members and all the other things that I’ve got planned for Commentluv after this mini little launch.</p>\n<p>So this is what you do, on the 12<sup>th</sup> of June keep an ear out because I am sending the email out and making  a video on Facebook on twitter and stuff like that and I will be giving you a chance to get Commentluv premium for more than 50% off.</p>\n<p>And, it’s using a special coupon code which I will tell you now: helpandy. All one word, all lower case letters, and use that as your coupon code and you will get more than 50% Commentluv premium and all the extras and stuff that I’ve got in line for Commentluv premium updates.</p>\n<p>Okay then, so keep an eye out, keep an ear out, keep an, &#8211;oh I don’t think there is anything else to keep… keep a figure tip out if you are reading braille. So keep everything out if it’s not too cold and I will get back to you nearer the time and just let you know how you are going to get extra 50% off, &#8211;more than 50% off Commentluv Premium, it’s totally worth it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://comluv.com/bol-newsletter-55-best-category-winner-and-big-sales-news/\">BOL Newsletter #55 &#8211;

I was playing about with the staff I was making it good, and it looked good. I’ve got a voice over, music and stuff like that. Then someone pointed out to me that it had a typo in it, it said “the the”, and I just hadn’t seen it before. Al l that time I spent looking into the video and I didn’t even see that typo. So I had to redo it all again, and another 18 hours of rendering and another editing and oh blahahahah.</p>\n<p>So I’ve come to the conclusion that absolutely positively something must be done about my video editing suite. I need to get a new one; new software, new hardware. It used to be good but that was years and years and yonks ago.So I want to get a new one. And also this month it’s my birthday, which is brilliant by the way because now I get to be older!</p>\n<p>So as traditional on my birthday I do something good for the customers and for non-customers and stuff like that and so, I am going to combine my absolute desire and need for a video suite that actually works with my birthday, and I am going to do some sort of extravaganza, but it’s not going to be too extravagant because you know I am sick. So you’ve got an opportunity now within the next couple of weeks to get something really special and really good. I’ve got to work on that this week and I will let you know by email and by osmoses you will find out what’s going on.</p>\n<p>And if you are a Commentluv Premium user then I would love it if you would send me an email and get in touch with me and connect with me because there may be some way that you can help me get my video editing suite and it won’t cost you anything more than just time. I mean talk about articles or videos or even just promising to do a tweet on a particular time. I would really love it if you’d get in contact with me. Of course I won’t reply straight away, but I will reply I promise. I promise, I promise, I promise. Oh god what have I set myself up for now?</p>\n<p>But, definitely I need a new video editing suite. It’s so horrible to have to wait hours and hours and hours for something to render and think it’s done and then it’s not; and then having to do it all over again. Such a pain in the ass. I really want a video editing suite and then I could do really cool tutorials for like really good stuff that I can show you and then you can say ‘oh I am really glad you got the video editing suite’ or something like that.</p>\n<p>So watch out in the next couple of weeks I am going to be emailing and Facebooking and videoing too, and I will be telling you about my new video editing suite. And, there is something special that I am going to do for my birthday for everyone.</p>\n<p>Actually I think it will be good because every time I’ve done it before people say ‘oh that’s brilliant’. And it will be brilliant again, mark my words. Just keep an eye out.

I’ve got stuff to do; I have an afternoon nap later and stuff like that. But let me just tell you, this week, next week I won’t be appearing in your inbox because my friend from London is coming up and we are going to spend a week doing some silly stuff, mostly playing Xbox. But, Tom sent me an email asking me about, well he’s not the only one loads of people of other people have sent me email saying about how do I make that walk and talk video?</p>\n<p>How do I get it to look like its being filmed on an expensive steady cam. You’ve seen the ones where they make proper movies from and it stops all the jiggity jiggity. And other people have asked me do you have a pauperize following you? And I was like ‘No’, but I would like to be a famous enough to have a pauperize, and other people think I’ve got a crew or someone is following me or walking backwards with a camera. And how do I make it look so smooth and stuff like that.</p>\n<p>And basically I’ve got a stick that I straighten out on a telescopic mono pod and a camera on the end. And my mate what he is going to be able to do when he comes up is he is going to be able to film me while I am filming myself because I can’t do both at the same time, and from that I will be able to do a little tutorial video for exactly how I do the walk and talk, and how to make it smooth and how to use the extra features of YouTube so it looks professionally smoothed out.</p>\n<p>It’s really quite cleaver and it’s quite easy and it’s really quite quick. So within a few weeks I will be able to really start and you will be able to watch that and make your own walk and talk video. I would love to be able to see some of your stuff.</p>\n<p>Next we’ve got the promo video and I am not asking for more feedback because I have spent so much time on this promo video now. I listened to the first lot of feedback and I am putting it all together in my editing app and I am putting sound tracks to it, I’ve got a Morgan Freeman voice over and I’ve got loads of little screen shots, screen saves, and screen grabs that I am going to put in there as well. So hopefully that will explain what the plug-in sort of does.</p>\n<p>And after that, I have got to send all of those suggestions from you about what you would like to be taught when you were a new blogger or what advice would you give, and I will be sending that to the writer, and the writer will be dealing with that and we will be having a little chin wag and stuff and feedback. And that will be given back to me sometime next month sometime.</p>\n<p>So you know things are moving on and it’s going really nice, but I think I might need another nap or 2 before that’s all done, but definitely I want to say thanks very much for watching these videos and giving me the comments and all the feedback and all the support I got on the Facebook page, on twitter, on the blog, on the board tickets, on the email. All of that stuff, I do read every single one of your suggestions and your comments and your emails and I love to hear from people.</p>\n<p>I read every single email. I can’t always rely, and I can’t always get feedback immediately to you, but I definitely really love to get all these emails and the support, and all the questions as well because now I get to answer you. And things like Tom asking for you know how I make the videos and the other people that have asked and now I get to show you. So that’s coming in a few weeks the videos coming and I might be able to give you a secret preview of the promo video in a couple weeks after I have had my week off.</p>\n<p>And I’ve got to see what else is coming up. Oh I’ve got to award the prize to the best suggestion for the best subject. I will do that in a few weeks as well because there are some really good suggestions, and I am loving that. That means I don’t have to think of them either. Brilliant, all of this stuff has just been done for me. I’ve only have got to pay thousands of dollars to get it made. Thanks very much for that and I will see you in a couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://comluv.com/holidays-walk-talk-questions-video/\">BOL newsletter# 53 &#8211;  Away for a week &#038; Questions on walk &#038; talk video</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://comluv.com\">ComLuv</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"andy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"http://comluv.com/holidays-walk-talk-questions-video/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"BOL newsletter 52 – Personal Assistant &amp; Sales Video\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"http://comluv.com/personal-assistant-job-sales-video/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"http://comluv.com/personal-assistant-job-sales-video/#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 18 May 2014 01:00:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Newsletter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"personal assistant\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"sales\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"http://comluv.wpengine.com/?p=25296\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8813:\"<p>Here&#8217;s the video and transcription of this weeks newsletter</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/phcW9hj0KaA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Here is the link Trello that I&#8217;d like for you to use, join up for free and get me a free month of gold! </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://trello.com/andybailey5/recommend\">Join Trello here</a></p>\n<h2>Contest Winner</h2>\n<p>And this weeks winner is Vagabond Tim from <a title=\"Bindlestiff\" href=\"http://bindlestiff.ca/\">Bindlestiff</a> who recently wrote about <a title=\"Busses, I am not so fond of\" href=\"http://bindlestiff.ca/busses-i-am-not-so-fond-of/\">Busses, I am not so fond of</a></p>\n<p>well done!,maybe someone will leave a comment on your blog to say well done (hint hint!) and get a backlink for the trouble <img src=\"http://comluv.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>(it will be up to you to claim your prize of a lifetime license to Commentluv Premium, you have until next weeks newsletter comes out)</p>\n<p>why not head over and leave them a comment to let them know the good news!</p>\n<h2>[Transcript]</h2>\n<p><strong>Transcript: Newsletter #52 Personal Assistant and Sales Video</strong></p>\n<p>Hey and welcome to another newsletter. I am not out and about walking along the canals today because the weather is not so great and also my leg is not so great too, but I am sitting next to the cabbage. Next to them growing. I am really proud of them they are looking lovely. I will give you a tour of them one day.</p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;ve got 4 things to mention in this video.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got personal assistant,</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got more subjects for the ten email series from an expert.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got that changes to the sales video that I have done, and the contest.</p>\n<p>So first thing the personal assistant. Now I’ve heard and I’ve read all before from other entrepreneurs or business owners or successful people like that and they say ‘what is the biggest thing you regret?’ And quite a few times I’ve seen people say that you know ‘I regret not getting someone to do it for me, I tried to do everything myself, I was a control freak’, and that was the main stopper to their growth and they found that when they started employing people to do the things that they could do repetitive task then they were able to do more stuff generate an income or give ideas and you know more use of their time.</p>\n<p>Now I can see their point because I am starting to bring on people that are paid to do a certain number of things for me, and I can see their point about that being a stopper to them growing their business because you know, if they spent all day trying to edit a video that could be done by someone for $10 an hour than they are not doing stuff that is earning them big money. So really I could see their point about that, but also on the other side of the coin I can see that advantage of doing everything yourself. I am quite technically capable.</p>\n<p>You could say I am a proper geek, nerd guy! And so, doing all of these different things for the business it was never a problem for me and in fact in the beginning I didn&#8217;t even know it was going to be a business. And so, I had no choice but to do, if I wanted it done I did it myself, and I have become used to that. And that advantage to that is that when you get a bit of news that can affect your business like “by the way here you&#8217;ve got a chronic condition”.Then I am free to put the business not on hold, but put it on go slow for a little while because I don’t have any obligational requirement to make sure the people that I am employing have enough work to do so I don’t have to sack them.</p>\n<p>Which is kind of how my Bricks and Mortar Business with my Mrs. and the Chinese take away. We’re to have a certain element and level of business to be able to pay the staff that make the business happen, and if we don’t have enough business to pay that staff we’ve got to find that money from somewhere. So there is an added bit of pressure, and pressure is not what I need when I&#8217;ve got this condition because it does funny things to me I’ll tell you!.</p>\n<p>But that being said I am bringing on someone as a personal assistant and they will be able to do the things that I’ve broken down into steps that they can follow: A, B, C, D. You know process a video. This video will be his baptism of fire so to speak and so he is going to process this video and do all the other things that happen when a newsletter video comes on. That’s like edit the video, turn it into a blog post, and send out the newsletter that kind of thing. So good luck Adnan that is going to be your job today.</p>\n<p>Okay the second thing I want to bring up is Sales video.  I don’t know if I said that secondly in the beginning but the sales video. I am being quite disabled this week, but I have done a lot for some source of music for the video so it goes corporate then sad, then corporate, and then happy, and then corporate. That kind of thing, which is a difficult thing to do actually when you are browsing through these music files you think ‘oh that will work, or that would work’ and so on. Oh it’s a bloody nightmare.</p>\n<p>Next we’ve got the suggestions for you know emails from an expert and so I want more suggestions  because I’ve got  another week now to accumulate all suggestions and choose the best ones and send them off to the writer, and the writer will get them done and we will have a little feedback and chin wags about it. And then I will be able to put it into the system for new members. And so, if you&#8217;ve got a suggestion it’s basically now you are an experience blogger (if you are) what advice would you give to yourself in the past?, what would you say to yourself just to make blogging a little bit easier on you or less time consuming or less worrying and stuff like that.</p>\n<p>Or what would you like to have been told by an expert when you first started blogging. What would have made your blogging life easier? So send me an email, send me a support ticket, send me a response on the YouTube video, and send me a comment on the blog post. I will choose all the best ones. I will get 10 of them, send them off to the writer, and the person with best suggestion wins $100, which I shall pay next month sometimes and let everybody know what they won and what they said and what they suggested and all that kind of stuff.</p>\n<p>Talk of wining, the contest is going really well so the last one been claimed, the one before that has been claimed. So check the blog post on Comluv.com for this newsletter and then you can see who won the premium license and this is a life time license as well so they always get constant updates as well as when I have released them as well instead of having to pay a recurring fee. The way that you can enter this contest is just use Commentluv, not even Commentluv premium, just use Commentluv and get some comments. More than one comment on your blog to get some Commentluv and I will get to know about that when the stats get updated every couple of weeks and then I will choose people that are using the latest version that got a comment and I will award them a life time premium license. Now if that one person is a premium member then they get a license to give away on their blog for anyone else, it is transferable.</p>\n<p>All right, come to the blog and see who won. Send me suggestions for what you would like to be advised about blogging when you first started blogging and cross your fingers for Adnan who is going to be processing this video and transcribing it, and turning it into a blog post and newsletter. Hopefully I have done all the videos and the updates and put down the steps and set the column in the boards in the cards in trello that I can follow the which aspect he is doing and can follow along like that.</p>\n<p>If you are interested there is this thing called trello and I just mentioned it before. It’s a free project management system and it is really good for what I want to do and it’s free, but if someone joins through my link then I get a free month of gold so it’d be really nice if you look at the link below and you click through the trello join that and I will get notified that you are then and maybe I will give you something nice as well. All right, so I will see you next week.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://comluv.com/personal-assistant-job-sales-video/\">BOL newsletter 52 &#8211; Personal Assistant &#038; Sales Video</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://comluv.com\">ComLuv</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"andy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"http://comluv.com/personal-assistant-job-sales-video/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"BOL newsletter 51 – turning a fail in to a success and special email series by an expert\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"http://comluv.com/voiceover-timing-email-series/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"http://comluv.com/voiceover-timing-email-series/#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 May 2014 11:00:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Newsletter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"email series\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"morgan freeman\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"http://comluv.wpengine.com/?p=25213\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8087:\"<p>Here&#8217;s the video and transcription of this weeks newsletter<br />\n<iframe width=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lMTOydheTYo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Contest Winner</h2>\n<p>And this weeks winner is Sky Nealon from <a href=\"http://sky-nealon.com/blog/\">Empowering Life and Success through Online Marketing</a> who recently wrote about &#8220;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http://sky-nealon.com/blog/p2s-week-12-visualising-ideas/\">Visualising Ideas</a>&#8220;</span></p>\n<p>well done!,maybe someone will leave a comment on your blog to say well done (hint hint!) and get a backlink for the trouble <img src=\"http://comluv.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>(it will be up to you to claim your prize of a lifetime license to Commentluv Premium, you have until next weeks newsletter comes out)</p>\n<p>why not head over and leave them a comment to let them know the good news!</p>\n<h2>[Transcript]</h2>\n<p>transcript: BOL newsletter #51</p>\n<p>And today, welcome to a windy newsletter. God bimmie it&#8217;s just got a bit windy now, god blimmie governor.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I have some points to make. I have a fail, then from that fail a nearer success I don&#8217;t know yet, and then something else that you could help me out with. So listen out to the end because I will be asking you to help me with something. And also a little hint, a little allusion to something that I&#8217;ve got going on with Commentluv premium or especially with new people that are coming into Commentluv premium.</p>\n<p>First thing is a bit of a fail. Remember the last week I was talking about making a video and then doing some sort of voice impression or something like Morgan Freeman to narrate a story or something like that.</p>\n<p>And then well I did do something about like that, and I&#8217;ve got a guy, got a voice over artiste to have a look at some lines of script and stuff and he was going to say these lines and then I was going to match him up to the video and it is going to look brilliant. Well, in my mind&#8217;s eye anyway. But I didn&#8217;t because it sounded too robotic.</p>\n<p>It sounded exactly like Morgan Freeman, because it was all separate sentences. You know. Just say one sentence than pause, then say another sentence then pause. Now originally I thought it was a good idea to match the video up to the words or match the words to the video; to the timing of the video. But, the best videos are ever made I&#8217;ve done the opposite. I&#8217;ve got the audio sorted, and then got the video to match fully with the audio and that worked sweet.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking about doing this. But anyway, I spent money on it and the guy did it, he did a good job. He did as exactly what I asked him to do, but it didn&#8217;t turn out very nice. You know too robotic.<br />\n(robotic voice) Say hello to Mary. Mary is very sad. Mary is…</p>\n<p>You know I can&#8217;t do it like that. So something good came out of it though because I actually sat down and I wrote a proper story. You know a script and it brought up 3 main pain points of people that are starting to blog or just getting established on a blog. And then the solution for to those things, and then I&#8217;ve left the demo part of it to speak for itself. You know because then I could put up flashpoints to point out particular things and those could change. You see because If I&#8217;ve got some guy narrating the whole thing, all the features, and the benefits and stuff, in the future when there&#8217;s more features, more benefits then I&#8217;ll have to pay the guy to repeat what he did, but with the new benefits and the new features. If you know what I mean, so now I&#8217;ve got a more generic script that I can use and sorted mate.</p>\n<p>Okay now the bit that you can help me with is also is integrated with what plans I got and what I have done is I got in contact with an expert. Because you know when the new bloggers they install Commentluv. Well. Not all new blogger, not all people that installed it, but a large majority of people; they want to know how can they now help. Not just install it and expect comments and traffic come flooding in. In the same way, you just can&#8217;t buy a diet book and then just lose weight because your buying a diet book. You actually putting on weight, the weight of the book. So you&#8217;ve got to take action, but what action do you take?</p>\n<p>Do you listen to the people in the &#8220;Warrior Forum&#8221;? Do you listen to the people that say ‘they are blog experts&#8217; and stuff? So I am paying thousands of dollars to a blogging expert; who is just bloody brilliant by the way. And they are going to write a series of 10 emails that will welcome in someone that has just bought the plugin and show them the first steps.</p>\n<p>They are like mini courses if you will and written by a proper good expert. I don&#8217;t want to release the details yet because it isn&#8217;t fully committed, not all the parties have fully signed off on it. But you gonna love it! It is really brilliant. Well actually, I have to do some Shenanigans there so for existing members can get access to it, but this is a real added value thing that I&#8217;m adding to it.</p>\n<p>I wanted to do this ages and ages ago, and then I couldn&#8217;t because sales weren&#8217;t up cause I was sick, and I was like &#8220;Poor me&#8221;. And I couldn&#8217;t make loads of sales and do promotions and stuff. Then I put the idea on the back shelf. But now that I am gearing up for another kind of mini launch and re-launch type of affair where I am able to work on few hours a day during the week you know, regardless of my condition because of the good medication that I am on.</p>\n<p>And while I am here, I thought I would reinvent that idea and I will ask that person, &#8220;Are they willing to do it?&#8221; and they said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;, but I got to get 10 subjects to them before the end of May. So that there is enough time to write before. Apparently, babies are coming.</p>\n<p>Hoo.. How exciting. But anyway, give me 10 subjects not even 10, give 1 subject. What 1 thing would you have liked to have known how to do or know what to do or where to start or things like that.</p>\n<p><strong>What 1 thing would you have liked someone that was an expert in blogging to tell you when you started blogging? </strong></p>\n<p>Just give me 1 subject. Whoever gives me the best subject would win a hundred dollars. I am going to commit to that, on camera. Okay. So whoever gives me the best subject, send an email, send a comment, post a comment on the youtube video, on the Facebook page, on the blog. Send me an email to get support; anything. Send me an idea of what you would like to be told when you was a beginner blogger. If you had the chance to get something told you by an expert.</p>\n<p>What would have saved you time? What advice you would give now that you&#8217;ve been blogging for a while? What would you give to a new blogger? Something like that.</p>\n<p>So whoever&#8217;s got the most creative or the most interesting or the most loody dah comment, okay, I would give them a hundred dollars. That&#8217;s all you have to do. Come up with what you would have liked to be told or when you are a beginning blogger. What would have helped you? So that&#8217;s the thing for today.</p>\n<p>Send me the idea and also watch out for the video because I&#8217;ve got a feeling that the voice over guy got the story now. He is going to record it the next couple of days. I got a feeling that it is going to be brilliant. Hmm…But I felt like this before.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it is going to be brilliant!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://comluv.com/voiceover-timing-email-series/\">BOL newsletter 51 &#8211; turning a fail in to a success and special email series by an expert</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://comluv.com\">ComLuv</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"andy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"http://comluv.com/voiceover-timing-email-series/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"BOL newsletter 50 – great feedback that causes work and look at my chicken!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"http://comluv.com/video-sales-letter-feedback-and-chicken-cacciatore-recipe/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"http://comluv.com/video-sales-letter-feedback-and-chicken-cacciatore-recipe/#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 May 2014 07:14:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Newsletter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"chicken cacciatore\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"morgan freeman\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"http://comluv.wpengine.com/?p=25148\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6093:\"<p>Here&#8217;s the video and transcription of this weeks newsletter on how bloomin sick I am!</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/f9ZcZGL-0P0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h2>Contest Winner</h2>\n<p>And this weeks winner is this person from <a href=\"http://www.postagejournal.com/\">Postage Journal</a> who recently wrote about <a href=\"http://www.postagejournal.com/sundaystamp-85for-children/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&#8220;Postage Stamps for Children&#8221;</span></a></p>\n<p>well done!,maybe someone will leave a comment on your blog to say well done (hint hint!) and get a backlink for the trouble <img src=\"http://comluv.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>(it will be up to you to claim your prize of a lifetime license to Commentluv Premium, you have until next weeks newsletter comes out)</p>\n<h2>[Transcript]</h2>\n<p>transcript: BOL newsletter #50</p>\n<p>Hello and welcome to another newsletter. As you can tell by me walking about, and not lying in bed going oh gah blah, I am feeling a little bit better and I have still got heavy legs but what the hell, I have been carrying my legs for all my life and I&#8217;m pretty used to that.</p>\n<p>Oh, blimmey what a hard thing is to edit that video!</p>\n<p>What was I doing listening to all the awesome feedback?, I could have just whack it up there and hope for the best, but instead, I listened to you people and a lot of people mentioned about those squiggly letters moving up and down which I&#8217;ll have to look at it again I thought – at first I thought it was oh it&#8217;s magic and then now I think, oh yeah, I see your point.<br />\nI have calm them down a bit, I said,</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_25149\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-25149\" src=\"http://comluv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Calm-your-tits_o_857534-300x188.jpg\" alt=\"\'Calm your tits, come down,\'\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" />\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Calm your tits, come down,</p>\n</div>\n<p>and they did after bashing the computer for about hours. Blimmey that was hard work. Then I got someone else who said&#8212;,</p>\n<p>Oh have a look at this picture!</p>\n<p>This is my chicken cacciatore.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_25150\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://uktv.co.uk/food/recipe/aid/656122\"><img class=\"wp-image-25150 size-medium\" src=\"http://comluv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/chickencattiatore-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Chicken Cacciatore Recipe at &lt;a href=&quot;http://uktv.co.uk/food/recipe/aid/656122&quot;&gt;http://uktv.co.uk/food/recipe/aid/656122&lt;/a&gt;\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chicken Cacciatore from http://uktv.co.uk/food/recipe/aid/656122</p>\n</div>\n<p>Have a look.

It&#8217;s got red peppers, but I used the chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts because that&#8217;s all I had.<br />\nThat&#8217;s got nothing to do with anything, plug-ins all business, but I want to show someone because my Mrs. works in the kitchen cooking stuff and she was like, &#8216;Yeah, whatever.&#8217; So she&#8217;s not impressed by cooking things, I am and hopefully you too. I&#8217;ve put the recipe of it there, below the video somewhere so you can find out how to make that too because it is a really nice recipe and lots of other people said this is really tasty too.<br />\n<!-- in_post_square_dating ad [*7*] cat [!0!] --></p>\n<div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1361899283625-7\" style=\"width:300px; height:250px;\">\n            <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\"div-gpt-ad-1361899283625-7\");});\n            </script>\n            </div>\n<p>\nNext I&#8217;ve got to tell you something else as well.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, well done for all the contest winners. Someone got in contact with me and got a license and then there is the other person this week as well, you&#8217;ll find out on my blog on the post where this newsletter appears.</p>\n<p>And then I&#8217;ve got another I can talk to you about as well, I was going to say I&#8217;ve told you about video that I&#8217;m doing that&#8211; Oh yeah, I&#8217;m going to do some live actions stuff or maybe some narrative stuff by – maybe get Morgan Freeman to do it or someone who sounds like him because again, that was another feedback where someone said that the demo area or part of it was a bit short and so you couldn&#8217;t really get an idea of what the plug-in does from the video;</p>\n<p>and after getting some emails from people saying, &#8216;What does your plug-in do for people that can&#8217;t read web pages?&#8217; I thought, I&#8217;ve got a – it&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s my fault, but still I&#8217;ve got enough responsibility to explain what it is on video, and for that I am going to have to extend those demo pieces. I can&#8217;t really do it in the videos. We are going to have to do some shenanigans to do that as well.</p>\n<p>I will make the videos this week to put into the placement there and I will get them narrated or live action or me pointing at things saying, &#8216;Look,&#8217; maybe not and then that will be done. That&#8217;s only like six weeks behind schedule, but as I said I don&#8217;t do schedules so, I&#8217;m on schedule, huh how about that?.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t do schedules so how can I be on it?

You can even embed <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/\">previews of posts</a> from other WordPress sites by pasting the URL on its own line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have been a lot of changes for developers to play with as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>REST API (phase 1) </strong>— The underlying infrastructure of the WordPress REST API <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/\">plugin</a> has been <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/21/wp-rest-api-merge-proposal/\">included in WordPress 4.4</a>.

Also, the underlying <code>WP_Term</code> class improves caching when working with terms. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/14162\">#14162</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Improved <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> output</strong> — <code>wp_title()</code> is now deprecated; WordPress can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/20/document-title-in-4-4/\">handle the rendering</a> of the document title automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Comments </strong>— Comment queries are now split for performance.

From managing<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/you-can-now-search-for-and-install-plugins-from-within-jetpack-manage\"> plugins, themes, and other updates</a> to <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/beautiful-makeover/\">New Dash</a> and a revamped <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/new-post-screen/\">post editor</a>. The individual changes represent iteration but when seen as a whole, show off an entirely new WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>Automattic has <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-new-wordpress-dot-com/\">announced</a> that the improvements its made in the last two years are part of an internal project <a href=\"https://desktop.wordpress.com/\">named Calypso</a>. The company also released a WordPress.com desktop application for the Mac and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/\">open sourced</a> the code on <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>The application is written entirely in JavaScript using the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node</a> and <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a> libraries. It&#8217;s also <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/\">100% reliant</a> on APIs, including the REST API.</p>\n<h2>My Experience with Calypso</h2>\n<p>Over the weekend, I tested the application on my Macbook Pro. I initially thought it was inconsistent as there were many instances where a button opened a browser and took me outside the app. However, Calypso has gone through a number of updates and most of the inconsistencies have disappeared.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso1.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49080\"><img class=\"wp-image-49080 size-full\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso1.png?resize=1025%2C795\" alt=\"Calypso1\" /></a>Calypso\n<p>Most of what you&#8217;re able to accomplish in the WordPress backend you can do in the app including, editing posts, creating drafts, and moderating comments.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49081\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49081\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso2.png?resize=1025%2C799\" alt=\"Calypso2\" /></a>Although there is the occasional Beep&#8230;.Beep&#8230;.Boop, the application is fast. Some of the pages within the app feel like they load faster than their browser counterparts. Some things still require action from within a browser such as applying updates. This doesn&#8217;t make sense considering the Jetpack Manage module is enabled.</p>\n<p>When managing themes, I noticed at least two of the them don&#8217;t include the white bottom bar making the titles difficult to read. Also, the details link loads a browser window to the backend of the site I&#8217;m managing. It feels like an interruption instead of a seamless experience. There should be no reason to load a browser window except for previewing a post.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso3.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49082\"><img class=\"wp-image-49082 size-full\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso3.png?resize=1025%2C790\" alt=\"Calypso3\" /></a>Managing Themes in Calypso\n<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with or use the WordPress.com post editor, the editor in Calypso is pretty much the same.</p>\n<p>For years I&#8217;ve written posts with meta boxes on the right and getting used to them on the left will take a while. The editor has most of the features available in WordPress. For example, oEmbed support which many other third-party WordPress apps don&#8217;t have.</p>\n<p>When the application is in full-screen mode, it looks great and blocks out distractions. In the most recent update however, the Preview button acts like a Save button and doesn&#8217;t show a preview of the post. This is likely a bug and will be fixed in a later version.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CalypsoPostEditingScreen.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49083\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-49083\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CalypsoPostEditingScreen.png?resize=1025%2C790\" alt=\"CalypsoPostEditingScreen\" /></a>Calypso is a great example of what&#8217;s possible with the WordPress REST API. There are still a few instances when clicking a button takes you outside the app but those will be fixed in future updates.</p>\n<p>Overall, it&#8217;s convenient to have access to most of WordPress&#8217; features without interacting with a browser. For those who use a Mac, I can easily see Calypso being the preferred way to interact and manage WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>As Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/\">mentions in his post</a>, there&#8217;s still a lot of work left to do, &#8220;This is a beginning, not an ending. (<a href=\"http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/\">1.0 is the loneliest</a>.) Better things are yet to come, as all of you dig in.&#8221; Calypso is <a href=\"https://desktop.wordpress.com/\">available for free</a> but you&#8217;ll need a <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/start\">WordPress.com account</a> which is also free.</p>\n<p>If you own a Mac and test drive Calypso, please share your experience with us in the comments.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 18:01:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"Post Status: Automattic has released an open source WordPress.com Mac app\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=14990\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-com-mac-app/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4876:\"<p>Today, Automattic released their official WordPress.com Mac app, that was codenamed <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-new-wordpress-dot-com/\">Calypso</a> during development, that allows users to manage both WordPress.com and Jetpack enabled websites using a desktop interface.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video walkthrough:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The new WordPress.com app development occurred over the course of at least 18 months, according to the press release, with input from more than 140 Automatticians. <a href=\"http://apeatling.com/about-me/\">Andy Peatling</a>, who has been at Automattic since 2008, was the project lead.</p>\n<h3>If you could rebuild the admin from scratch</h3>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg said that Automattic wanted to completely rethink the WordPress admin experience, without the burden of backward compatibility that WordPress core must hold sacred:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What would we build if we were starting from scratch today, knowing all we’ve learned over the past 13 years of building WordPress?</strong> At the beginning of last year, we decided to start experimenting and see.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Calypso is an ambitious project. Not only does it bring the WordPress editing and publishing experience to a Mac app, but pretty much the entire WordPress.com admin experience is now available on the desktop, from stats to theme shopping.</p>\n<p>While the app is definitely geared toward the experience one would expect on a WordPress.com website, you can also manage <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/2015/11/23/jwordpress-com-app-for-mac/\">Jetpack enabled</a> websites with it. The Jetpack Manage feature must be enabled for it to work, and I admit I struggled to get it to function with my own (personal) website. However, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll get any kinks worked out, and anyone looking for basic website management, but are on WordPress.org, may enjoy the experience.</p>\n<h3>Open sourcing WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>The most important part of the announcement is that Automattic is open sourcing Calypso and the many APIs that help drive it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A lot of people thought we should keep this proprietary, but throughout my life I’ve learned that the more you give away, the more you get back. We still have a ton to figure out around plugins, extensibility, contributions, Windows and Linux releases, API speed, localization, and harmonizing the WordPress.com API and WP-API so it can work with core WordPress. Thousands more PHP developers will need to become fluent with Javascript to recreate their admin interfaces in this fashion. I’m also really excited to revisit and redesign many more screens now that we have this first version out the door.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m really glad they chose to open source it. I agree with Matt that both the app and the broader community will benefit from the decision; though I don&#8217;t doubt it may have been a tough sell to investors.</p>\n<p>I also agree with Ben Thompson (a former Automattician, by chance), <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2015/tensorflow-and-monetizing-intellectual-property/\">who once said</a> that proprietary software itself isn&#8217;t necessarily what makes a company successful, but rather, &#8220;companies that are built on software but differentiated by a difficult-to-replicate complement to said software.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In Automattic&#8217;s case, open sourcing the techniques to build the app isn&#8217;t giving away what is most valuable. What is most valuable to them is what they gain from the open source nature of the software, that will allow them to improve the experience for their vast WordPress.com user base.</p>\n<h3>Calypso is a good step forward for WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve worried for a while now that Automattic may be letting their audience slip, by falling behind the ease of use of other tools, like Medium. I think the new WordPress.com editor, and the corresponding Calypso app, are a great improvement to the writing experience, and I think that the investment they&#8217;ve made is a smart one.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be digging more into the code and developer components of the new APIs and the Mac app soon. I didn&#8217;t have access to that data prior to launch.</p>\n<p>Calypso is available for <a href=\"http://desktop.wordpress.com/\">download from WordPress.com</a> now.

When I took on the <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/\">responsibility of CEO of Automattic January of last year</a>, we faced two huge problems: our growth was constrained by lack of capital, and the technological foundations of the past decade weren’t strong enough for the demands of next one.</p>\n<p>The first has a relatively straightforward answer. We found some fantastic partners, agreed on a fair price, <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-funding-for-automattic/\">issued new equity in the company to raise $160M</a>, and started investing in areas we felt were high potential, like <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/05/woomattic/\">this year’s WooCommerce acquisition</a>. This &#8220;war chest&#8221; gives us a huge array of options, especially given our fairly flat burn rate &#8212; we don&#8217;t need to raise money again to keep the company going, and any capital we raise in the future will be purely discretionary. (Since last May when the round happened we&#8217;ve only spent $3M of the investment on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense\">opex</a>.)</p>\n<p>The second is much harder to address. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> codebase is actually incredible in many ways &#8212; the result of many thousands of people collaborating over 13 years &#8212; but some of WordPress’ greatest strengths were also holding it back.</p>\n<p>The WordPress codebase contains a sea of institutional knowledge and countless bug fixes. It handles hundreds of edge cases. Integrates constant security improvements. Is coded to scale. Development moves at a fast clip, with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/\">six major releases over the past two years</a> and more <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-4/\">around the corner</a>. Its power and flexibility is undeniable: WordPress just passed a huge milestone, <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/11/seventy-five-to-go/\">and now powers 25% of the web</a>. You can run it on a $5-a-month web host, or scale it up to serve billions of pageviews on one of the largest sites on the web, <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The interface, however, has been a struggle. Many of us attempted to give it a reboot with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/23/mp6-3-8-proposal/\">MP6 project</a> and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2013/12/parker/\">version 3.8 release</a>, but what that release made clear to me is that an incremental approach wouldn&#8217;t give us the improvements we needed, and that two of the things that helped make WordPress the strong, stable, powerful tool it is &#8212; backward compatibility and working without JavaScript &#8212; were actually holding it back.</p>\n<p>The basic paradigms of wp-admin are largely the same as they were five years ago. Working within them had become limiting. The time seemed ripe for something new, something big… but if you&#8217;re going to break back compat, it needs to be for a really good reason. A 20x improvement, not a 2x. Most open source projects fade away rather than make evolutionary jumps.</p>\n<p>So we asked ourselves a big question. <strong>What would we build if we were starting from scratch today, knowing all we&#8217;ve learned over the past 13 years of building WordPress?</strong> At the beginning of last year, we decided to start experimenting and see.</p>\n<p>Today we&#8217;re announcing something brand new, a new approach to WordPress, and open sourcing the code behind it. The project, codenamed Calypso, is the culmination of more than 20 months of work by dozens of the most talented engineers and designers I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with (127 contributors with over 26,000 commits!).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-45613\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2015/11/gm-2015-final.jpg?resize=604%2C431\" alt=\"gm-2015-final\" /></p>\n<p>Calypso is&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incredibly fast. It&#8217;ll charm you.</li>\n<li>Written purely in JavaScript, leveraging libraries like <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node</a> and <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React</a>.</li>\n<li>100% API-powered. Those APIs <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/\">are open</a>, and now available to every developer in the world.</li>\n<li>A great place to read, allowing you to follow sites across the web (even if they&#8217;re not using WordPress).</li>\n<li>Social, with stats, likes, and notifications baked in.</li>\n<li>Fully responsive. Make it small and put it in your sidebar, or go full-screen.</li>\n<li>Really fun to write in, especially the drag-and-drop image uploads.</li>\n<li>Fully multi-site for advanced users, so you can manage hundreds of WordPresses from one place.</li>\n<li>Able to manage plugins and themes on <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/\">Jetpack</a> sites, including auto-upgrading them!</li>\n<li>100% open source, with all future development happening in the open.</li>\n<li>Available for anyone to adapt to make their own, including building custom interfaces, distributions, or working with web services besides WordPress.com.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A lot of people thought we should keep this proprietary, but throughout my life I&#8217;ve learned that the more you give away, the more you get back. We still have a ton to figure out around plugins, extensibility, contributions, Windows and Linux releases, API speed, localization, and harmonizing the WordPress.com API and WP-API so it can work with core WordPress. Thousands more PHP developers will need to become fluent with JavaScript to recreate their admin interfaces in this fashion. I&#8217;m also really excited to revisit and redesign many more screens now that we have this first version out the door.</p>\n<p>This is a beginning, not an ending. (<a href=\"http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/\">1.0 is the loneliest</a>.) Better things are yet to come, as all of you dig in.

Like any disruption it is uncomfortable, and I&#8217;m sure will be controversial in some circles. What the team has accomplished in such a short time is amazing, and I’m incredibly proud of everyone who has contributed and will contribute in the future. This is the most exciting project I&#8217;ve been involved with in my career.</p>\n<p>With core WordPress on the server and Calypso as a client I think we have a good chance to bring another 25% of the web onto open source, making the web a more open place, and people&#8217;s lives <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/\">more free</a>.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious more about the before and after, what&#8217;s changed, here&#8217;s a chart:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45626\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2015/11/Whats-New-WPcom@2x.png?resize=604%2C1300\" alt=\"Whats-New-WPcom@2x\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 17:01:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: Nearly Half of the WordPress Plugins in the Directory Are Not Updated After Two Years\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=49050\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"http://wptavern.com/nearly-half-of-the-wordpress-plugins-in-the-directory-are-not-updated-after-two-years\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2813:\"<p>Luca Fracassi, founder of <a href=\"https://addendio.com/\">Addendio</a>, an alternative search engine for the WordPress plugin and theme directories published an <a href=\"https://addendio.com/2015-will-be-a-record-year-for-wordpress-plugins/\">in-depth look</a> at the WordPress plugin directory. The post includes data that shows the number of plugins added to the directory per year, what year the plugins were last updated, and other metrics.</p>\n<p>My favorite data point is the number of plugins approved per year. Based on this data, it looks like it&#8217;s going to be another record year for the directory. The five active team members including, Mika Epstein, Pippin Williamson, and Samuel Wood have their work cut out for them.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NumberOfPluginsAddedPerYear.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49062\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-49062\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NumberOfPluginsAddedPerYear.png?resize=939%2C684\" alt=\"Number of Plugins Added Per Year\" /></a>Number of Plugins Added Per Year\n<p>According to the data, about 22K plugins have been updated in the last 24 months representing a little more than half the directory. This means that approximately half of the plugins in the directory are displaying a notice that the plugin hasn&#8217;t been updated in two years.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PluginUpdateTwoYearNotice.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49066\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-49066\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PluginUpdateTwoYearNotice.png?resize=785%2C84\" alt=\"Update Notice After Two Years of No Updates\" /></a>Update Notice After Two Years of No Updates\n<p>Fracassi says that based on the data, &#8220;Two out of ten plugins are updated after three years. If you pick a free plugin that is released today, there’s a 80-90% chance that in three years time you won’t have any more updates.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are a number of possibilities as to why a plugin doesn&#8217;t get updated for two years or more.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The developer burns out or moves on.</li>\n<li>The plugin doesn&#8217;t need an update.</li>\n<li>Lack of donations.</li>\n<li>Support is too much of a burden.</li>\n<li>No time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The data doesn&#8217;t spell doom and gloom for users but it clearly shows that many plugins within the directory don&#8217;t have a long shelf life. I encourage you to <a href=\"https://addendio.com/2015-will-be-a-record-year-for-wordpress-plugins/\">read Fracassi&#8217;s post</a> and review the data he&#8217;s collected.

Some theme authors are having to <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=new&status=reopened&keywords=!~buddypress&col=id&col=summary&col=priority&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=time&col=changetime&report=5&order=priority\">wait two months</a> or more for their first review.</p>\n<p>Ashley Evans submitted <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318\">her theme</a> in June and she&#8217;s yet to complete the review process. Throughout that time period, both Evans and the reviewer experienced delays in responding to each other. A few months into the review, the <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318#comment:21\">reviewer disappeared</a> and Evans was <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318#comment:23\">assigned a new reviewer</a> two days ago.</p>\n<p>Understandably, the experience has discouraged Evan&#8217;s from submitting anymore themes to the directory:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Back in August, I said, &#8216;Screw it&#8217; and released the theme as a free download on my blog. This process has basically made me vow to stick to adding plugins to the repo and stop adding any more themes.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not blaming the theme review team since I can only imagine how much stuff they have to wade through. It&#8217;s just sad that the process has discouraged me from ever doing it again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On October 9th, Tammie Lister <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/10/09/forgotten-review-push-sometimes-themes-get-forgotten-in/\">updated the Theme Review queues</a> and identified a number of themes that fell through the cracks. Most of those <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?id=26151,26016,26194,25318,26167,25685,25310,25818,25650,26135,26195,25000,23405,23342,24027,24087,24094,24101,24143,24178,24203,26164,26084,24277,25651,24597,24411,25269,25992,25217,24540,25980,25969,25814,25245,25241,25181,25154,25122,25076,25068,24274,24993,25046,24178,24087,24101,24143,24765&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=status&col=time&col=reporter&report=30&order=time\">themes were approved</a> or are still in the review process.</p>\n<h2>The System is Broken</h2>\n<p>Members of the WordPress Theme Review team agree that the system is broken. In June, the team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/suggested-roadmap/\">published its suggested roadmap</a> to improve multiple facets of the review process. One of the items on the list to help cut down the review queue is the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/10/07/automation-here-we-come/\">auto-approval</a> of theme updates. However, the team is still hard at work trying to code and implement changes to improve the system.</p>\n<h2>Help Them Help You</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/school.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-27795\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-27795\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/school.jpg?resize=1025%2C487\" alt=\"photo credit: Rob Shenk via - cc\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/rcsj/2915797223/\">Rob Shenk</a> via &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>One of the items high on the team&#8217;s to-do list is to put more effort towards education. In order to do that, Justin Tadlock says the team has to free up resources, &#8220;We need to free up our biggest resources, which are the team members themselves. However, we can&#8217;t free up those people when they&#8217;re spending 100% of their time doing reviews.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The most important thing theme authors can do to speed up the review process is to check that your theme meets the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/\">Theme Review Requirements</a>. According to Tadlock, &#8220;The majority of themes submitted don&#8217;t follow the guidelines which considerably slows down the process. Themes will often have 20-30 issues or more. If we can get to a point to where the majority of submissions only have a few minor issues, we really wouldn&#8217;t have a queue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Theme authors who test their themes against <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test\">Theme Unit Test Data</a> and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/\">Theme Check Plugin</a> substantially improve the system for everyone. What the team needs most is help. Tadlock offers three ways contributors can get involved to improve the situation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">Doing reviews</a>.</li>\n<li>Tackling Meta Trac tickets related to the theme directory.</li>\n<li>Writing tutorials.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tadlock isn&#8217;t sure how to get theme authors to raise the quality of their themes before the initial review, &#8220;That&#8217;s the sort of feedback I want to see from fellow theme authors. What do we need to do to help them get their themes ready before submission?&#8221;</p>\n<h2>How to Get Involved</h2>\n<p>The team is always in need of more theme reviewers. Reviewing themes is a great way to learn theme development and what not to do. If you&#8217;re interested in reviewing themes, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">following document</a> from the Theme Review Handbook. It explains how to set up a testing environment with an example of a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/review-workflow/\">testing workflow</a>.</p>\n<p>The Theme Review Team also has a project meeting every <a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20151110T1800\"><abbr class=\"date\" title=\"2015-11-10T18:00:00+00:00\">Tuesday, November 10, 2015, 1:00 PM EST</abbr></a> in the <strong>#themereview</strong> channel on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Slack</a>.</p>\n<h2>Exercise Patience</h2>\n<p>Exercising patience is a difficult thing to do if you&#8217;ve already waited eight weeks or more for the first review. However, fixing the system is going to take time. If you want to know about the status of your theme and it has an assigned reviewer, you should ask for a status update within the ticket. If your theme doesn&#8217;t have an assigned reviewer, you can ask about its status in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Theme Review Team Slack</a> channel with a link to the theme.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 17:20:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: Imperva’s Web Application Attack Report Shows Spam Is WordPress’ Largest Security Threat\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48995\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"http://wptavern.com/impervas-web-application-attack-report-shows-spam-is-wordpress-largest-security-threat\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6738:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.imperva.com\">Imperva</a>, an international cyber security company founded in 2002, published its <a href=\"http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed6.pdf\">2015 web application attack report</a>.

WordPress applications suffered from 3,497 attacks in the reported period which is 250% more than non-CMS Applications. Note from the above image that spam attacks against WordPress outnumber all other types of attacks.</p>\n<p>Imperva says the attraction to CMS applications, especially WordPress is not new.</p>\n<blockquote><p>CMS frameworks have an open nature,  with open developer communities that generate a never-ending sequence of plug-ins and add-ons, with varying levels of security. This situation has led to corresponding never-ending flow of CMS vulnerabilities, with WordPress as the leading CMS taking the lead also in the amount of published attacks.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the fact that WordPress and other CMS applications resemble each other facilitates automated scanning attacks that work effectively on all applications of this type with only minimal adjustments.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Varying levels of security in plugins have led to many vulnerabilities making WordPress the leader in the amount of published attacks.</p>\n<h2>Proportions of Attacks</h2>\n<p>Taking spam attacks out of the equation, the most popular attack type against WordPress applications is (RCE) Remote Command Execution with (RFI) Remote File Inclusion taking second place.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackTypeProportions.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-49000\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-49000\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackTypeProportions.png?resize=719%2C400\" alt=\"Proportion of Attack Types\" /></a>Proportion of Attack Types\n<ul>\n<li>Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is an attack that allows an attacker to include a remote file, usually through a script, on the web server. This attack can lead to data theft or manipulation, malicious code execution on the web server, or malicious code execution on the application client side such as JavaScript execution, which can lead to other attacks. This vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote Command Execution (RCE) is an attack that allows the attacker to execute operating system commands in a system shell. The attack exploits applications that suffer from insufficient input validation in conjunction with passing this input to a system shell. The attacker’s payload is executed with the same privileges of the vulnerable application and can lead to full compromise of the server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though the other monitored CMS applications are written in PHP, RFI attacks on WordPress are significantly higher than all other applications. Imperva offers one possible explanation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Attackers don’t target a specific application, but start with scanning the Internet for vulnerable applications. A Low Hanging Fruit approach that is simple and effective for the detection of potential RFI targets, would be to run a WordPress test and mount an RFI attack in case of success.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed6.pdf\">report</a> goes on to show geographic attack trends, PHP vs non-PHP attack incidents, traffic volume, case studies, and more.</p>\n<h2>No Need to Panic</h2>\n<p>Even though it&#8217;s only six months of data, the results don&#8217;t surprise me. WordPress is <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/a-quarter-of-the-top-10-million-sites-ranked-by-alexa-use-wordpress\">used on a quarter of the top 10 million websites</a> ranked by Alexa so of course its going to be the most attacked CMS.</p>\n<p>The data in the report reinforces my belief that every public site online is likely being scanned or attacked multiple times a day. Unless you&#8217;re using a service or plugin that logs these types of attacks, its hard to know how popular of a target a site is.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re aware of a plugin or service that provides a user-friendly interface that shows and explains the attacks it&#8217;s protecting against a site, please send me a link in the comments.</p>\n<h2>Basic Security Principles</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s imperative that you use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication\">strong password</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication\">two-factor authentication</a>. Consider using a service like <a href=\"https://getclef.com/\">Clef</a> that allows you to login to WordPress without a password. I also highly encourage you to read the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-publishes-security-white-paper\">WordPress security whitepaper</a> to learn how WordPress protects itself against common attacks mentioned in Imperva&#8217;s report and how to responsibly disclose a WordPress security vulnerability.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 02:11:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WordPress Freelancer Adam Soucie on the Dangers of Accepting Credit Cards\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48990\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-freelancer-adam-soucie-on-the-dangers-of-accepting-credit-cards\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2202:\"<p>If you&#8217;re running or opening a new WordPress business, you should read <a href=\"http://adamsoucie.com/chargebacks-the-dangers-of-accepting-credit-cards/\">Adam Soucie&#8217;s warning</a> on the dangers of accepting credit cards. Soucie, a WordPress Developer based in Orlando, Florida describes what happened after working with a client that claimed to be hearing disabled.</p>\n<p>Soucie went through the usual process of sending over a contract, bringing in a designer, discussing scope, and sending over an invoice. The client then claimed to be in the hospital and requested help to pay for one of the contractors involved in the project because he didn&#8217;t accept credit cards. According to Soucie, this should have been the red flag:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I ignored it because I’ve also been a trusting person who is sympathetic to people with disabilities.  Plus I figured I had proof of everything, so I’d be protected.  I was so wrong.</p>\n<p>To make a long story short, the &#8216;client&#8217; was paying with stolen credit cards and the other contractor was in on the scam.  I discovered the scam when they started getting pushy about the contractor receiving his payments.  When leaving to make the final payment, I got a call from the person whose credit card info was stolen.  I reached out to my &#8216;client&#8217; and she had disappeared.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As the merchant, Soucie was liable for the transaction. After not receiving help from the FBI Cyber Crimes division and the credit card companies, QuickBooks, Soucie&#8217;s payment processor, went after him for the total amount of $10,000. He was able to get the amount slightly reduced after working with QuickBooks. What looked like an awesome project quickly turned into a nightmare.</p>\n<p>I highly encourage you to <a href=\"http://adamsoucie.com/chargebacks-the-dangers-of-accepting-credit-cards/\">read his article</a> as it includes tips to protect yourself and why you shouldn&#8217;t be too trusting.

Haskins was initially going to list the company on Flippa but after receiving advice from <a href=\"https://syedbalkhi.com/\">Syed Balkhi</a>, used <a href=\"http://feinternational.com/\">FE International</a> to facilitate the sale. FE International is composed of website brokers that do the heavy lifting to help businesses find buyers.</p>\n<p>An anonymous company based on the US East Coast without ties to the WordPress community is the new owner of Aesop Interactive LLC. Although terms of the deal are not public, Haskins confirms that he received close to his asking price of $100K.</p>\n<p>When Haskins put the company up for sale, he specified two conditions the new owner must follow.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Aesop Story Engine MUST absolutely be maintained and kept free.</li>\n<li>Editus must continue forward with development, in some way shape or form.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear what the new owner&#8217;s plans are for Aesop Story Engine, Editus, and Story.AM.</p>\n<h2>Advice for Selling Your Company</h2>\n<p>The WordPress ecosystem is filled with thousands of companies from individuals to 50+ person agencies. Haskins offers the following advice for those thinking about selling their business, &#8220;Make sure that the books are buttoned up tight, because every check, every payment, every expense will be scrutinized and will ultimately determine what the appraisal price will be. Run a lean ship as the less overhead you have, the better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During the appraisal process, Haskins had to account for and explain every check number written during the last few months. Although it was a lot of work on his end, he highly recommends using FE International as they manage the negotiating, contract writing, and appraisal processes.</p>\n<h2>What’s Next for Haskins?</h2>\n<p>Haskins isn&#8217;t giving up WordPress development as he continues to work with the software on a daily basis managing <a href=\"https://cgcookie.com/\">CGCookie</a>. When I asked what&#8217;s next in his WordPress journey, he replied, &#8220;Overall, there will be another project. It&#8217;s just that this chapter of the story is finished. I want to eventually write and publish an eBook on my experiences of starting, running, and selling a business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Who do you think the buyer is and what do you think will happen to Aesop Story Engine, Editus, and Story.AM?</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 22:31:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: Tickets on Sale for WordCamp Europe 2016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48959\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"http://wptavern.com/tickets-on-sale-for-wordcamp-europe-2016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2056:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WordCampEuropeFeaturedImage2.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-48961\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48961\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WordCampEuropeFeaturedImage2.png?resize=1025%2C450\" alt=\"WordCamp Europe Featured Image\" /></a>Nearly seven months before the event takes place, tickets for <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2016/\">WordCamp Europe 2016</a> in Vienna, Austria on June 24-26 <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2016/tickets/\">are on sale. </a> There are two types of tickets available, General admission and Microsponsor.</p>\n<p>General admission tickets are € 40.00 each and cover both days to the event, <span class=\"tix-ticket-excerpt\">access to all sessions, lunch, coffee breaks, warm up events, and the after party.

Launched in 2009 as a plugin called Site Monitor, the service has evolved over time to allow users to upgrade themes, plugins, and WordPress remotely. The service allows an unlimited amount of sites to be tracked for free.</p>\n<p>Human Made is not able to devote the time and resources necessary to maintain the service, even as it continues to do well. According to Tom Willmot, Co-founder and CEO of Human Made, the team backed out of the <a href=\"https://wpremote.com/2013/10/04/the-new-wpremote/\">premium version</a> of the service due to a lack of resources:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We had <a href=\"https://wpremote.com/blog/\">ambitious plans for a version 2</a>, we <a href=\"https://wpremote.com/2013/10/04/the-new-wpremote/\">introduced a premium version</a> that we backed out of because we didn’t have the resources to run and grow it, and we’ve got lots of great ideas both from its users and ourselves that we haven’t been able to act on. We’re too busy with other things, including Happytables, our client work, events, and more.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WP Remote has over 18K users with more than 96K sites monitored. Here are some other notable statistics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1,850 people logged in during the past 30 days.</li>\n<li>1,200 of those have more than five sites added to their account and 110 of them have more than 50 sites monitored.</li>\n<li>In the past 30 days WP Remote was used to perform over 20,000 plugin updates.</li>\n<li>Each week between 50 and 100 new users sign up and over half of them go on to add a site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although WP Remote converted 60 free users to its premium service, the company eliminated it due to the lack of internal resources to support, develop, and market it. WP Remote also has key relationships with web hosting companies such as, Pressable, BlueHost, and SiteGround.</p>\n<p>Before inquiring about purchasing the service, I recommend that you <a href=\"https://wpremote.com/2013/08/08/the-story-of-wp-remote/\">read the history</a> on how it was created. If you&#8217;re interested in acquiring WP Remote or have questions, contact Tom at  <a href=\"mailto:tom@hmn.md\">tom@hmn.md</a>.

The site launched earlier this year and has more than 170 plugins listed in the directory. Gliebe doesn&#8217;t have the time to manage the project anymore and is looking to give it to someone who is capable of maximizing the site&#8217;s potential.</p>\n<p>Since May of this year, commercial plugin developers have slowly added their products to the directory. Gliebe explains his original strategy for monetizing the site, &#8220;Build the directory up (get authors to list their plugins) in order to attract traffic (plugin buyers) then monetize it with display ads, affiliate links and/or sponsorships (not yet started).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gliebe spends 1-2 hours per week managing the directory which includes, moderating submissions, moderating comments, moderating reviews, answering emails, and responding to tweets. He suggests that the new owner will need to spend more time marketing in order for the project to keep growing.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting parts of the sale offer is where Gliebe explains what powers the site:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The site is powered by Easy Digital Downloads, the <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/frontend-submissions/\" target=\"_blank\">Frontend Submissions</a> extension, the <a href=\"https://easydigitaldownloads.com/downloads/product-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">Product Reviews</a> extension and Array’s <a href=\"https://arraythemes.com/themes/checkout-wordpress-theme/\" target=\"_blank\">Checkout</a> theme (using a child theme for customizations like showing categories on the homepage).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Looking at the analytics, the site is experiencing low traffic numbers compared to when the site was launched. However, organic search traffic is steadily rising thanks to the content published on the <a href=\"https://proplugindirectory.com/blog/\">site&#8217;s blog</a>.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ProPluginTrafficStats.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-48925\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48925\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ProPluginTrafficStats.png?resize=814%2C1216\" alt=\"Pro Plugin Directory Traffic\" /></a>Pro Plugin Directory Traffic\n<p>Outside of Codecanyon, Pro Plugin Directory is one of the only other directories exclusively catered to commercial plugins. Here&#8217;s what Gliebe will give the buyer after purchasing the site:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The buyer will receive the domain, website files, database dump, mailing lists and Twitter account. Easy Digital Downloads add-on licenses and Checkout theme licenses will be transferred. You will need to purchase a new SSL certificate. I am looking for a capable buyer but if you require migration assistance or technical support after the sale, I will offer my services at $200/hour (five hours max).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Escrow will be used to facilitate the sale between both parties.

Clarke</a> in 1974, which I&#8217;ve embedded above, where he said the following right around 0:56.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Interviewer: I wonder though, what sort of a life will it be in social terms if our whole life is built around the computer, if we become a computer-dependent society, computer-dependent individuals.</p>\n<p>ACC: In some ways, but they&#8217;ll also enrich our society because it&#8217;ll make it possible for us to live anywhere we like. Any businessman, any executive could live almost anywhere on earth and still do his business through a device like this, and this is a wonderful thing, it means we won&#8217;t have to be stuck in cities, we can live out in the country or wherever we please, and still carry on complete interaction with human beings, as well as with other computers.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Wow, extremely prescient.

The dominant technology companies of today still follow the same office-centric model as when computers took up entire rooms, but the dominant companies of tomorrow will be built and grow in a completely distributed fashion.

The <a href=\"https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">schedule and sessions</a> are published and it looks like an informational packed two-day event.</p>\n<p>There are three tracks available, two of which will have typical length sessions with a third track dedicated to lightning talks. I highly encourage you to <a href=\"https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">view the schedule</a> and create a list of sessions to attend as the first day has over 40 of them.</p>\n<p>Reed Gustow, one of the event&#8217;s primary organizers says they&#8217;re expecting a lot of attendees, &#8220;We&#8217;re expecting 2,000 attendees from across the United States and from many other countries, and it will be a wonderful opportunity to learn, share knowledge and meet others in the amazing WordPress community.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to WordCamp US, there will be a <a href=\"https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/11/09/join-us-for-the-wordcamp-us-contributor-day/\">WordPress contributor day</a> on December 6th. During contributor day, people from all walks of life get together and contribute to various parts of the WordPress project whether it&#8217;s the support forums, core code, documentation, and more. Mentors will be on hand to help new contributors.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, the most important information is where to eat a great tasting cheesesteak. After all, it&#8217;s one of the things <a href=\"http://www.visitphilly.com/itineraries/philadelphia/where-to-find-the-best-cheesesteaks-in-philadelphia/\">Philadelphia is known for</a>. The WordCamp US organizing team has you <a href=\"https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/2015/11/09/the-cheesesteak-post/\">covered with a post</a> that describes the different types of cheesesteaks and where to find the best tasting ones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://2015.us.wordcamp.org/location/\">Hotel and venue information</a> for the event is on the WordCamp US website.

Only 1.25% of WordPress sites in the survey are hosted at WordPress.com.</p>\n<h2>The Fastest Growing CMS</h2>\n<p>The survey also shows that WordPress is still the fastest growing CMS, &#8220;Every 74 seconds a site within the top 10 million starts using WordPress. Compare this with Shopify, the second-fastest growing CMS, which is gaining a new site every 22 minutes,&#8221; Gelbmann says.</p>\n<p>When sites are broken down into languages, WordPress is used on 37.3% of English language sites. Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish sites are inbetween 38-40% while Bengali is 51.3% and 54.4% for Bosnian. Only 10.6% of WordPress sites are in Chinese with 6.9% for Korean.</p>\n<p>About 94% of sites surveyed use a Unix-like operating system such as Ubuntu. Windows servers host 6.2% of WordPress sites making it the most popular CMS running on Windows servers.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg, Co-founder of the WordPress project, says the <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2015/11/seventy-five-to-go/\">largest opportunity for growth</a> is in the 57% of sites not using <em>any</em> identifiable CMS. Earlier this year, we learned that <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-important-is-jetpack-on-wordpress-road-to-50-market-share\">Jetpack is going to play a significant role</a> in WordPress gaining 50% or more of market share.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"http://kitchensinkwp.com/podcast-e048-interview-with-matt-mullenweg/\" target=\"_blank\">interview with Adam Silver on the KitchensinkWP podcast</a>, Mullenweg explains the path to 50% and beyond.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The next goal is the majority of websites. We want to get to 50%+ and there’s a lot of work between now and then. As the percentage increases, it gets harder and harder to grow the market share, and we have to grow the market share by doing things we haven’t done in the past – really thinking about the onboarding process, really thinking about the integration with social networks, and with how WordPress works on touch devices, which is going to be the predominant computing platform of the future. These things are going to be really important.</p>\n<p>What got us here isn’t going to get us there.

Communicating online is hard but where and how you communicate affects the likelihood of making an impact.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cmscritic.com/\">CMS Critic</a> is a site I&#8217;ve read for years as it routinely publishes articles on a variety of content management systems, including WordPress.</p>\n<p>In late October, Kaya Ismail <a href=\"http://www.cmscritic.com/how-wordpress-needs-to-improve-itself/\">published an article</a> that describes how WordPress needs to improve itself in six ways. What could have been a great article, is instead a great example of <strong>how not to</strong> communicate grievances you have with WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Twenty Sixteen Developers Are Lazy</h2>\n<p>Many people, including myself <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/first-look-at-the-twenty-sixteen-default-wordpress-theme#comments\">have an opinion</a> of the Twenty Sixteen theme in WordPress 4.4. Ismail thinks the developers behind the theme are lazy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I totally understand that WordPress doesn&#8217;t need to compete with the massive library of third-party themes available out there, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they should lead with a default theme as bad as that. It&#8217;s nothing short of lazy.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Tammie Lister, Takashi Irie, and others continue to work hard on Twenty Sixteen to prepare it for the WordPress 4.4 release in December. They are far from lazy people making Ismail&#8217;s opinion more of an insult. He doesn&#8217;t provide any examples or ideas on what should be in a default theme.</p>\n<h2>The WordPress Plugin Directory</h2>\n<p>According to Ismail, the WordPress plugin directory is filled with large chunks of trash in addition to great plugins. While some plugins in the directory could be coded better, his explanation falls short of describing a solution.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Many plugins simply don&#8217;t work, while many more are poorly put together, which in turn makes WordPress as a platform harder to use. Quality control needs to improve.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He doesn&#8217;t link to plugins that are broken, provide any code samples, or show where quality control is lacking. His statement is an assumption that&#8217;s not backed by evidence.</p>\n<p>Those who <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/behind-the-scenes-in-the-wordpress-plugin-directory-with-mika-epstein\">oversee the plugin directory</a> don&#8217;t test every submitted plugin to make sure it works with WordPress. Among other things, their job is to make sure plugin submissions don&#8217;t have security issues. If the moderators performed quality control on every plugin, the submission queue would likely have a substantial backlog.</p>\n<p>Instead of writing baseless assumptions, Ismail should monitor the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/\">Make WordPress Plugins</a> site to stay on top of what&#8217;s going on with the plugin directory and submit feedback where necessary. If a broken plugin is discovered, he should create a forum thread within the plugin&#8217;s support area.</p>\n<p>This way, his feedback is seen by those who directly control the WordPress plugin directory. The simple act of reporting a broken plugin to the developer is a major step towards being part of the solution and not the problem.</p>\n<h2>Admin Menu Clutter</h2>\n<p>I agree with Ismail&#8217;s opinion that the WordPress admin menus can become cluttered if the right plugins are activated. At least in this case, he suggests an alternative.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d like to see WordPress group third-party menu options together, in a way that&#8217;s a little more organized and less intrusive. Perhaps this can be done by giving them a sub-section within the menu which can be collapsed. The solution itself is up to them, but the problem is evident.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Menus\">are guidelines</a> for when plugin developers should create top-level or sub-level menu items but they&#8217;re not followed as well as they could be. Without strictly enforcing these guidelines, it&#8217;s out of WordPress&#8217; hands. The complaint is aimed in the wrong direction and should point towards third-party developers, not WordPress itself.</p>\n<p>If you want more control in how items are displayed in the admin menu, I recommend using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/menu-humility/\">Menu Humility</a> plugin by Mark Jaquith.</p>\n<h2>Akismet is Not Enough</h2>\n<p>According to Ismail, comment spam is a major issue with WordPress sites and Akismet doesn&#8217;t do enough to stop it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Akismet, a spam comment filter, now comes with every WordPress install &#8211; which is a good thing. But the free version doesn&#8217;t do enough for me, as comments still pile up in the back end. If you ask me, WordPress needs to find another way to turn the unrelenting tide of spam.</p></blockquote>\n<p>To clarify, Akismet has been bundled with WordPress since <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2005/12/wp2/\">version 2.0</a> and there&#8217;s no difference between the free and commercial versions in how Akismet protects sites. He doesn&#8217;t provide any suggestions on what WordPress could do to thwart spam but says it has to do something.</p>\n<p>What are members of the WordPress core team supposed to do with this kind of feedback? It&#8217;s not helpful, doesn&#8217;t provide any ideas, and is easy to discard.</p>\n<h2>Updates are Hard</h2>\n<p>Depending on your webhost&#8217;s configuration, updating themes, plugins, and WordPress is as simple as clicking a button. For the more adventurous, you can configure them to happen automatically. For Ismail, the update process is difficult.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Updating a plugin may cause conflicts between it and another plugin. Updating a theme can erase your modifications (unless you use a child theme), whereas updating WordPress itself can render a variety of your plugins redundant until their developers apply a patch. Confused yet? You should be.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He makes a few good points but editing a theme instead of a child theme is like editing WordPress core files which should almost never happen. It&#8217;s true that there is a slight risk of <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/plugin-developers-demand-a-better-security-release-process-after-wordpress-4-2-3-breaks-thousands-of-websites\">things breaking</a> after an update but it&#8217;s more of an anomaly than a common occurrence.</p>\n<p>Ismail suggests that WordPress look into preserving theme changes across the board and to provide alerts if  plugins interfere with each other. I like these suggestions and my hope is that one day, WordPress will be able to create a snapshot during the update process to provide assurance that the site won&#8217;t break after an update is applied.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Hack-a-thon</h2>\n<p>Ismail&#8217;s last point is how WordPress can improve its security.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think we can all agree that WordPress needs to beef itself up (by shoring up its admin login page, for example), but I call for it to go a step further and start offering better protection, even if it comes at a small price.</p>\n<p>Third party solutions exist, sure. But why should I have to patch together several security plugins, each with their own confusing settings, just to secure my website? Many WordPress users have become accustom to handling their own security in this way; but I think WordPress needs to take on more responsibility.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He wants WordPress to go a step further and offer better protection but doesn&#8217;t say what that protection is. He also doesn&#8217;t explain where, how, or why WordPress should take on more responsibility to make sites more secure.</p>\n<h2>Be Part of the Solution, Not the Problem</h2>\n<p>Ismail concludes his article by saying it&#8217;s time for WordPress to innovate. He also says, &#8220;The onus isn&#8217;t on me to provide the solution, it&#8217;s upon WordPress. And it&#8217;s about time they started coming up with innovative solutions for their long-standing issues.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The article is <a href=\"https://www.cmscritic.com/wordpress-4.4-beta-bare-bones/\">another example</a> of how CMS Critic chooses not to be part of the solution. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but airing grievances which sound more like demands and telling core developers to start innovating is not a recipe for results.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/contributing-to-wordpress/\">This quote</a> from WordPress core developer, Mark Jaquith, eloquently describes how important communication skills are in an open source project.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The number one skill you need for just about any job, but specifically working on open source, is communication skills. You need to have clarity, consistency, compassion, relatability, a little bit of a thick skin and a decent sense of humor.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The onus may not be on Ismail or any of us to come up with solutions, but he and others can help discover and be part of solutions by taking an active role in giving constructive feedback in <a href=\"http://hughlashbrooke.com/2015/11/03/a-non-developers-guide-to-getting-involved-in-wordpress-core-development/\">the right place</a>.

The guide explains how and where to provide feedback and how important it is to beta test new features.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve used WP Tavern to advocate for and against features in WordPress. One of the best pieces of advice I can give non-developers is to organize your thoughts or stance on a specific feature or direction and publish them on your site. This allows you to control the conversation and gives you plenty of space to explain your perspective.</p>\n<p>A great example <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/help-me-add-comment-approval-notifications-to-wordpress\">is this post</a> asking for help to add comment moderation approval notifications to WordPress. I explain why it&#8217;s needed with a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33717\">link to the ticket</a> I created to keep track of the conversation. I prefer to write about potential features and based on feedback, I&#8217;ll either create a trac ticket myself or someone will do it for me with a link to the post.</p>\n<p>The Tavern is in the dashboard and is read by a large audience, including core developers. However, thanks to social media, a well constructed post with solid points will make the rounds on Twitter, Facebook, and within WordPress sub-communities.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s those posts and associated comments that serve as one of many foundations for change in WordPress without touching a line of code. Keep in mind that there&#8217;s no guarantee you&#8217;ll be able to directly influence WordPress core development with words alone, but respectful, in-depth conversations with differing opinions and perspectives are an important part of the community regardless.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 04 Nov 2015 08:42:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Daniel Bachhuber Raises More Than $17.5K to Develop a RESTful WP-CLI\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48819\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://wptavern.com/daniel-bachhuber-raises-more-than-17-5k-to-develop-a-restful-wp-cli\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1664:\"<p><a href=\"https://danielbachhuber.com/\">Daniel Bachhuber</a>, who maintains <a href=\"http://wp-cli.org/\">WP-CLI</a>, has successfully raised more than $21K through his <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danielbachhuber/a-more-restful-wp-cli\">Kickstarter campaign</a>.

Versions are displayed in a horizontal timeline format with fancy animations when hovered over.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WordPresstimeMachine.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-48815\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48815\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/WordPresstimeMachine.png?resize=1025%2C554\" alt=\"WordPress Time Machine\" /></a>WordPress Time Machine\n<p>Unfortunately, the animations are more distracting than they are useful and add a small delay when viewing images. The full-size images are not large enough and appear blurry when clicked on. If 93Digital removes the animations and uses larger images, the timeline would be a nice way to visually browse through WordPress&#8217; history.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to see clear, large images of past WordPress releases and learn about some of the key features in each version, I recommend reading <a href=\"http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/wordpress/wordpress-through-the-ages\">WordPress through the ages</a>.

In WordPress 4.4, it switches roles and is an oEmbed provider.</p>\n<p>Proposed by Pascal Birchler <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/\">earlier this year</a>, oEmbeds for posts streamlines how they&#8217;re shared across the web. Here&#8217;s an example of what an oEmbedded post looks like.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Content is displayed in an iFrame with a link to comments, a sharing button, and a link to the main page the article is hosted on. The continue reading link takes visitors to the source site. In the last three months, Birchler and members of the core team have worked hard to make sure embedded content is secure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The iFrames use the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#Attributes\">sandbox attribute</a> to enable extra restrictions on content that can appear in the inline frame.</li>\n<li>The host and the embedded site communicate via postMessage to allow resizing and clicking on links safely</li>\n</ul>\n<p>oEmbed discovery is turned on by default in WordPress 4.4. Too disable it, you&#8217;ll need install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-embeds/\">Disable Embeds</a> plugin. The plugin does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevents others from embedding your site.</li>\n<li>Prevents you from embedding other non-whitelisted sites.</li>\n<li>Disables all JavaScript</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/#comment-28263\">are requesting</a> that an option be added to disable oEmbeds rather than installing a plugin. In response to requests, Aaron Jorbin, WordPress core contributor, reemphasized <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/#decisions\">WordPress&#8217; philosophy</a> on adding options.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Every time you give a user an option, you are asking them to make a decision. When a user doesn’t care or understand the option this ultimately leads to frustration. As developers we sometimes feel that providing options for everything is a good thing, you can never have too many choices, right?</p>\n<p>Ultimately these choices end up being technical ones, choices that the average end-user has no interest in. It’s our duty as developers to make smart design decisions and avoid putting the weight of technical choices on our end users.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Birchler also responded saying, &#8220;The new embed functionality was developed with the majority of users in mind.&#8221; One of the largest problems with adding to options to WordPress is that they&#8217;re difficult to remove.</p>\n<p>Some WordPress developers are excited to see how post embeds can be extended. <a href=\"http://hughlashbrooke.com/\">Hugh Lashbrooke</a>, who works for Automattic, thinks post embeds will be great for Custom Post Types, &#8220;I think the oEmbed feature has loads of awesome use cases for Custom Post Types. For example, being able to embed eCommerce products on other sites with dynamic add to cart links,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to try post embeds is to log into <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/test-new-wordpress-features-without-installing-anything-via-trywpbeta\">TryWPBeta</a> using these credentials.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Username</strong>: wcpdx</li>\n<li><strong>Password</strong>: wcpdx15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Create a new post and make sure the visual editor is selected.

Joe McGill, who is helping to merge the feature to core, joined me for a thirty minute interview to explain how it works.</p>\n<p>When users upload images in WordPress, it automatically crops new images to smaller sizes. For example, if you upload an image that&#8217;s 1500 x 706, the image sizes might look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full Size &#8211; 1500 x 706</li>\n<li>Large &#8211; 500 x 235</li>\n<li>Medium &#8211; 300 x 141</li>\n<li>Thumbnail &#8211; 150 x 150</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional sizes are created depending on the theme. If the full size image is attached to a post, users on desktop and mobile devices will see the full size image. However, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to use the full size image on mobile devices because of its display and file size.</p>\n<p>Responsive images in WordPress 4.4 adds <code>srcset</code>&nbsp;and <code>sizes</code> support to WordPress. This allows the software to automatically use and display the right image based on a device&#8217;s screen size. If I attach a full size 1500 x 706 image to a post in WordPress 4.4, mobile devices will see the large or medium-sized image instead.</p>\n<p>Responsive images don&#8217;t have any settings to configure as the magic happens behind the scenes. I encourage you to listen to the interview as it may be easier to understand listening to us talk through the feature.</p>\n<div class=\"audio-shortcode-wrap\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ResponsiveImagesinWordPress.png?resize=175%2C131\" alt=\"Responsive Images in WordPress\" class=\"landscape thumbnail post-thumbnail audio-image\" /><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(\'audio\');</script><![endif]-->\n<a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Joe-McGill-Explains-Responsive-Images-in-WordPress.mp3\">http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Joe-McGill-Explains-Responsive-Images-in-WordPress.mp3</a></div><div class=\"media-shortcode-extend\"><div class=\"media-info audio-info\"><ul class=\"media-meta\"><li><span class=\"prep\">Run Time</span> <span class=\"data\">26:50</span></li><li><span class=\"prep\">Artist</span> <span class=\"data\">Jeff Chandler</span></li><li><span class=\"prep\">File Name</span> <span class=\"data\"><a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Joe-McGill-Explains-Responsive-Images-in-WordPress.mp3\">Joe-McGill-Explains-Responsive-Images-in-WordPress.mp3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"prep\">File Size</span> <span class=\"data\">12.09 MB</span></li><li><span class=\"prep\">File Type</span> <span class=\"data\">MP3</span></li><li><span class=\"prep\">Mime Type</span> <span class=\"data\">audio/mpeg</span></li></ul></div><button class=\"media-info-toggle\">Audio Info</button></div>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 29 Oct 2015 00:43:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: The WordPress Theme Directory No Longer Counts Automated Downloads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48766\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-theme-directory-no-longer-counts-automated-downloads\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5745:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/browse/popular/\">popular themes page</a> on the WordPress theme directory usually displays a mix of default themes and those that meet a certain criteria. While the criteria to reach the page is not publicly known, download counts are one form of measurement.</p>\n<p>Since September, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/swift/\">Swift theme</a> has routinely shown up on the popular themes page. According to download stats, Swift was downloaded between, 2,000 to 3,500 times a day in September and early October.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SwiftThemeDownloadNumbers.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48767\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SwiftThemeDownloadNumbers.png?resize=665%2C500\" alt=\"Swift Download Count\" /></a>Swift Download Count\n<p>However, the stats drop off abruptly on October 15th and have yet to reach previous levels. On October 18th, a few members inside the Theme Review Team Slack channel <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1445155458000095\">shared suspicions</a> that something was not right with Swift&#8217;s download stats.</p>\n<p>Ionut Neagu discovered that Swift does not appear on the <a href=\"https://garage.godaddy.com/top-100-wordpress-themes/\">GoDaddy Hot 100</a> while other themes on the popular page do. While not conclusive, the evidence points towards some sort of anomaly.</p>\n<p>Samuel &#8216;Otto&#8217; Wood, who helps maintain WordPress.org <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1445180169000105\">looked at the raw</a> data for Swift and discovered that a lot of the downloads appeared to be automated.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The swift theme is indeed getting an exceptional number of downloads, so I took a closer look at the raw data. It appears that a lot of these downloads are automated in some way. However, there&#8217;s no evidence that it is malicious, nor does the pattern apply only to the swift theme. Perhaps it is included in some installer system that auto-downloads themes for newly installed sites. It&#8217;s hard to say.</p>\n<p>In any case, I made a way to detect and block these types of automated downloads from appearing in the stats, and retroactively applied it for the last three days of data (which is all we retain). Going forward, automated downloads will not appear as downloads and will not affect the popular listings.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Once the changes were implemented, Swift&#8217;s download stats significantly decreased. The changes also apply to all other themes hosted on the directory. Otto declined to comment on the specific changes made but tells the Tavern, &#8220;If we can detect a case where downloads aren&#8217;t being made by users, then we will try not to count it in the results.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Swift’s Side of the Story</h2>\n<p>Satish Gandham, founder of <a href=\"https://swiftthemes.com/\">Swiftthemes</a>, explains what Swift has gone through the last few weeks which may account for the high download numbers, &#8220;Swift was featured for a couple of days and we spent money on Facebook ads to promote the free version. Also, there were a couple of hosted WordPress providers who asked permission to include Swift on their platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The premium version of Swift also had the same slug URL as the free version. The WordPress theme directory saw v7.2.48 to be higher than 7.2.6 and premium users downgraded to the free version thinking it was an upgrade. It was a support nightmare,&#8221; Gandham tells the Tavern.</p>\n<p>Swift&#8217;s <a href=\"https://swiftthemes.com/forums/topic/how-to-returning-to-version-7-2-6/\">support forums</a> confirm that some customers of the commercial version were automatically updated to the free version in early August.</p>\n<h2>Download Counts are Almost Irrelevant</h2>\n<p>When the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-launches-new-design\">plugin directory was redesigned</a> earlier this year, download counts were removed in favor of active installs. Active installs are more accurate and difficult to manipulate. On the other hand, when the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-directory-launches-new-design\">theme directory was redesigned</a>, download counts remained.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that the theme directory will one day show active installs but the data gathering aspect is not ready yet. Also, the numbers are lower for themes than for plugins, which may lead to incorrect conclusions in regards to relative popularity.</p>\n<h2>It Happens More Than You Might Think</h2>\n<p>In this particular instance, there&#8217;s no evidence that points to a malicious intent to inflate stats to manipulate the popular themes page. In the years I&#8217;ve written about WordPress, I&#8217;ve heard rumors that certain plugins and themes automate their download counts to appear more popular than they really are. However, I&#8217;ve yet to write about a theme or plugin caught in the act.</p>\n<p>According to Otto, it happens more often than you might think. When he or other volunteer moderators for the plugin and theme directories notice fishy download counts, they contact the author and the process usually stops. If it continues, the author risks having their themes and plugins suspended or banned from the directory.</p>\n<p>If you notice suspicious activity with a theme hosted on WordPress.org, you can voice your concern in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Theme Review Slack</a> channel during non-meeting times. For suspicious activity related to plugins hosted on the directory, email <strong>plugins at WordPress.org</strong>.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 28 Oct 2015 20:23:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"Post Status: Using WordPress as an application framework — Draft podcast\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=14800\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://poststatus.com/using-wordpress-as-an-application-framework-draft-podcast/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2245:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status Draft podcast, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a> and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Actions performed in one dashboard are mirrored to the other. Users can switch between the two with the click of a button.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ManageWPOrianOldNew.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48757\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ManageWPOrianOldNew.gif?resize=638%2C512\" alt=\"ManageWP Dashboard Compared to Orion\" /></a>ManageWP Dashboard Compared to Orion\n<p>Users can now sort sites by tags and clients in addition to groups. Websites can be assigned to clients while tags can describe whether a site is in development or live. Each site can up to five tags and one client.</p>\n<p>Unlike the native dashboard, Orion uses Angular.js which allows users to run asynchronous calls. For example, you can run more than one command why performing other tasks.</p>\n<p>One distinct difference between both dashboards is the way backups are generated. ManageWP backups and Orion backups are <a href=\"https://managewp.com/managewp-orion-developer-diary-3-bulletproof-backup-solution\">completely different</a> from each other. However, you can use both at the same time.</p>\n<p>The company says Orion comes with essential features but additional features will be completed and added by February of 2016 which is also when Orion will become the default dashboard.

He mostly uses WordPress for personal projects although he has completed a couple of projects for others. In addition to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kidsguide/\">maintaining a few plugins</a>, he&#8217;s an active translations contributor.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Automatic translations for plugins have been a long time coming. WordPress itself already auto-downloads and auto-updates core translations, so it is a natural progression that plugins and themes will receive the same treatment.</p>\n<p>For those who have been following auto plugin translations, it has <a href=\"http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/\">been in the works for years</a>. It came as a welcome surprise in September when it was announced that plugins will <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/09/01/plugin-translations-on-wordpress-org/\">finally be able to have language packs</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have a plugin in the WordPress.org directory, then this is important, welcome, and exciting news. However, as great as an initiative as language packs are for plugins, it <em>seems</em> simpler than it actually is.</p>\n<p>If you are a plugin developer, you have to go through a few steps in order to get this to work for your plugins. So let’s get started.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Should You Be Excited About Plugin Language Packs?</h2>\n<p>As a plugin author, I&#8217;m really excited about the new translation system, and so should you. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots team</a> is making it so that you no longer have to include all of your <code>.mo</code> and <code>.po</code> files directly in your plugin. Instead, they will be hosted on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48731\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-1.png?resize=582%2C575\" alt=\"screenshot-1\" /></a>The ideal scenario is when a user selects their language (either through a new WordPress install or through <code>Settings &gt; General</code>), the language pack for your plugin will be automatically installed and kept updated.</p>\n<p>This new system accomplishes a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plugin files are smaller. There&#8217;s no need to include translation files with your plugin.</li>\n<li>Plugin authors no longer need to manage translations/translators.</li>\n<li>End users are automatically able to see a plugin in their own language assuming a translation has already been created for their locale.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">How to Prepare for Plugin Language Packs</h2>\n<p>Before we jump into translating plugins, you first need to prepare your plugin for it to work with the new translation setup.</p>\n<p>In order for you to get your plugin prepared to be moved over to the new system, you need to change your text domain to exactly match your WordPress plugin slug. An important reminder is that even if you have changed your plugin&#8217;s name (as <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/\">Yoast SEO</a> recently did), the slug does not change. For a more in-depth discussion and tutorial, please follow Otto&#8217;s great post on <a href=\"http://ottopress.com/2013/language-packs-101-prepwork/\">language pack prepwork</a>.</p>\n<p>You are still welcome to include translation files in your plugin, even with language packs enabled. Translation files in your plugin take priority, and if those aren&#8217;t present, that&#8217;s where language packs come in.</p>\n<p>When you are preparing your plugin for language packs, it is important to note that you should avoid removing translation files from your plugin. If you do so, and your plugin is selected for language packs, your existing translations will not be automatically moved over to the new system.</p>\n<p>Do your best to keep your translation files with your plugin until the Polyglots team has informed you that your plugin is ready for language packs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Wait to Receive the Official Notice</h2>\n<p>The Polyglot team is preparing the plugins in stages to avoid any major hiccups. Assuming your WordPress.org email is up-to-date, you will receive an email when your plugin is ready.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering how long it takes before the team reaches your plugin. There are 40,000+ plugins on WordPress.org, so it is not a quick process. WordPress is preparing plugins in batches according to the amount of active installs each plugin has.</p>\n<p>If your plugin has over 30,000+ active installs, then chances are you are on the new system, although I&#8217;ve seen plugins with 10,000+ active installs also be approved.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to make the process quicker. Please practice patience and eventually your turn will come.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">You’ve Received the E-Mail That Your Plugin Is Ready</h2>\n<p>So you finally receive the email saying that your plugin is going to be uploaded with language pack support. Awesome! This is what the email that I received looks like. Note that I&#8217;m using one of my approved plugins as an example.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Howdy!<br />\n​<br />\nWe&#8217;re emailing you because you&#8217;re an author for the following plugin on WordPress.org:<br />\n​<br />\n* Easy Updates Manager : https://wordpress.org/plugins/stops-core-theme-and-plugin-updates/<br />\n​<br />\nNext week, we intend to import the plugin listed above into the translate.wordpress.org translation system. Language packs will also be enabled for your plugin, for any locales that are fully translated (at 100%).<br />\n​<br />\nAs part of this process, all of the strings in your plugin will be imported into translate.wordpress.org. Additionally, any language files that you ship with your plugin (&#8216;mo&#8217; files) will be imported and synced with their respective locales within translate.wordpress.org.<br />\n​<br />\nNo strings in your plugin? Plugin translations include the ability to translate the readme and display these translations in the localized WordPress.org plugin directories.</p>\n<p>If you have prepared your plugin already then this notice is of no real importance. If you have not yet prepared your plugin and you have received the notice then you need to prepare your plugin ASAP. If you don’t prepare your plugin then… well… I don’t really know, but it won’t be good. So go and prepare your plugin if you have not yet done so.<br />\n&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Your Plugin Is Semi-Ready for Language Packs. Now What?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-22.png\"><img class=\"alignright wp-image-48741 size-full\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-22.png?resize=291%2C321\" alt=\"screenshot-22\" /></a>A week or so after you receive the notice, your plugin and its translations are moved to <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org\">translate.wordpress.org</a>. You will likely not receive a notice when your plugin is moved.</p>\n<p>To find out if it&#8217;s been uploaded, visit your plugin&#8217;s WordPress.org page where you should see a translations section in the right sidebar. Click the <strong>Translate Plugin Name </strong>button<strong>.</strong> If you are brought to a page that looks like the one below then your plugin is uploaded and is ready to be translated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48734\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-3.png?resize=954%2C611\" alt=\"screenshot-3\" /></a>If you see a page that looks different from this (i.e., a Not Found error), your plugin is not yet ready.</p>\n<p>Assuming you&#8217;ve received the e-mail, your plugin is ready, and you&#8217;ve waited a reasonable amount of time, you should be good to go as far as preparing your plugin.</p>\n<p>If it has been over two weeks and your plugin has not yet been uploaded, you should contact the Polyglot team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">on their blog</a>, or in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">#polyglots channel on WordPress Slack</a>. Please exercise extreme patience as the process can take a week or sometimes even two.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Removing Your Translation Files From Your Plugin</h2>\n<p>Now that your plugin is uploaded to the system, you can safely remove the translation files from your plugin. If you don’t have any <code>.mo</code> and <code>.po</code> files in your plugin, then you can skip this step.</p>\n<p>One thing to note: You may not want to remove your translation files if your plugin does not have any translations on <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/\">translate.wordpress.org</a> or translations are not 100% complete.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Making Your Plugin Translatable</h2>\n<p>With all of that stuff out-of-the-way, it’s time to focus on translating your plugin. This is where it can get confusing but try to stick with me.</p>\n<p>By default, you cannot submit translations for your plugin in any language. Because of this, you need to ask the Polyglots team to add you as a translator for your plugin. You can do so by heading over to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/\">Polyglots blog</a> and ask them. To make it easier they came up with a template of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/rosetta/theme-plugin-directories/#sample-post\">what to say</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hello Polyglots!</p>\n<p>I am the plugin author for [plugin-name and link to plugin directory]. We have a number of great translation editors that we’d like to be able to approve translation for our plugin(s). Please add the following WordPress.org users as translation editors for their respective locales:<br />\no #ar – @username<br />\no #bn – @username, @username<br />\no #da – @username<br />\no #de-ch – @username<br />\netc…</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, just comment here. Thank you!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ideally, the above will include requests for multiple plugins, but as plugins are being rolled out slowly, it&#8217;s acceptable at the moment to include one request per plugin.</p>\n<p>Make sure that you use WordPress.org usernames and that the user is still active. If you are wondering what languages there are, you can visit <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/\">https://translate.wordpress.org/</a> and scroll through the different languages that WordPress supports.</p>\n<p>Please only ask to be added as a translator for the languages you know. You will not be approved if you are not a native speaker for a language.</p>\n<p>At this point, again, patience is needed. The Polyglot team will receive your request and will work through it. If your post doesn&#8217;t show up right away, it&#8217;s because first-time posters are moderated.</p>\n<p>In a week or two, the translators you requested should be added to your plugin. If there are any issues, a Polyglot member will comment on your request with any difficulties encountered or notify you that they have approved your request.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll know when you are added when you see new badges appear on your WordPress.org profile page. One is a translation editor badge and the other is a translation contributor badge.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-4.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48735\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-4.png?resize=601%2C322\" alt=\"screenshot-4\" /></a>How Do I Translate?</h2>\n<p>First, visit <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/\">https://translate.wordpress.org/</a>, select your language, then click the plugins tab. Search for your plugin and then click the translate project button. You&#8217;ll be brought to a page that looks like the one below. This page is where you can translate your plugin. In this case, my plugin is already translated in the language that I selected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-5.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48736\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-5.png?resize=957%2C587\" alt=\"screenshot-5\" /></a>On this table, there are four separate things to translate. Trunk, the stable release (version), and the <code>readme.txt</code> variations. In order for language packs to work, <em>you need to translate all four versions</em>.</p>\n<p>To translate, click on one of the sub-projects. This takes you to the translation page. Here, you can see all of the different strings that need to be translated in your plugin. You can edit a string by clicking the details button, translating it in the text editor, and then clicking the <strong>add translations</strong> button.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-6.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48737\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-6.png?resize=947%2C561\" alt=\"screenshot-6\" /></a>Even if you&#8217;re not added as an editor for a language, you can still translate a plugin. The only difference is instead of adding the translations directly, you can only request that it be changed. Someone from the Polyglots team will need review and approve your translation suggestions.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Once Your Translations Are Ready</h2>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve finished translating a language completely, it will be available for people to use. However, it doesn’t become available immediately. It can take one to three days for a translation to be available once you finish it. Again, exercise patience.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll know when the translation is available when you see it in the translation section on your WordPress.org plugin&#8217;s page. For example, you can see what it looks like in the picture below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-7.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-48744\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/screenshot-7.png?resize=447%2C377\" alt=\"screenshot-7\" /></a>Also, you&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s working if you go into a website (preferably not a live website), download your plugin, and select the language that you want to test in <strong>Settings &gt; General</strong>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"font-headlines\">Plugin Language Packs Are Here to Stay</h2>\n<p>Getting language packs to work properly in WordPress plugins is not exactly a straightforward process, which is precisely why plugins are being rolled out slowly.</p>\n<p>Please remember that everyone is a volunteer, from the Polyglots team, to translators, and to the plugin authors. Please give props where appropriate as everyone is working hard to make plugin language packs the norm.</p>\n<p>If you are having any trouble, the Polyglots team also has a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/\">handbook</a> available which provides some good information on how this new system works.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll also do my best to answer any questions in the comment section. If you have additional insight, please weigh in as well.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Oct 2015 02:52:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: Test New WordPress Features Without Installing Anything via TryWPBeta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48713\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"http://wptavern.com/test-new-wordpress-features-without-installing-anything-via-trywpbeta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3568:\"<p>Over the weekend at <a href=\"https://portland.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp Portland, Oregon</a>, Drew Jaynes, a WordPress core developer who also led the 4.2 development cycle presented on the topic of beta testing WordPress.</p>\n<p>In the presentation, Jaynes highlights the pros and cons of using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Testing plugin</a> on a testing site and a production site. However, he also cites a third way to test WordPress via <a href=\"http://wcpdx.trywpbeta.com/\">TryWPBeta.com</a>.</p>\n<p> \n<div> <strong> <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/DrewAPicture/trying-out-tomorrows-wordpress-today\" title=\"Trying Out Tomorrow’s WordPress Today\" target=\"_blank\">Trying Out Tomorrow’s WordPress Today</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/DrewAPicture\" target=\"_blank\">DrewAPicture</a></strong> </div>\n<p>TryWPBeta is a locked down, vanilla install of WordPress trunk using Multisite. To login to the site, use the following credentials.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Username</strong>: wcpdx</li>\n<li><strong>Password</strong>: wcpdx15</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I asked Jaynes what inspired him to create the site, &#8220;The inspiration for TryWPBeta is to actually have a place for core contributors to test patches on mobile devices, because setting up a tunnel to a local development setup is difficult and a high barrier for a lot of people.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The idea is to make it possible to spin up a site using trunk (Bleeding edge version of WordPress), apply a specific patch and then freeze it in time so that we can point people there to test on mobile devices,&#8221; Jaynes told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>While you can&#8217;t install themes and plugins yet, the site gives users an opportunity to test new features without worrying about breaking the site. Thanks to TryWPBeta, I was able to test the new <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/34903\">Post oEmbed feature</a> in 4.4.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TestingPostoEmbeds.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-48714\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TestingPostoEmbeds.png?resize=1025%2C458\" alt=\"Testing oEmbeds of Posts\" /></a>Testing oEmbeds of Posts\n<p>Jaynes started the project at 10up&#8217;s company summit. So far, Scott Reilly, John Blackbourn, Zach Brown, Morgan Estes, and Chris Weigman have contributed to the project. The site is hosted on a DigitalOcean droplet and updates hourly. He stresses that the site is a work in progress and not quite ready for prime time, &#8220;There’s a couple features I’d like to add to make it more robust first,&#8221; Jaynes said.</p>\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://demo.joomla.org/\">Joomla</a>, WordPress doesn&#8217;t have a dedicated demo site for users to test drive the software. While I like the idea behind TryWPBeta, there are a few things I&#8217;d like to see added to make it more useful. For instance, a list of items to test that users can check off.

In July of 2014, VersionPress conducted a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/versionpress-misses-crowdfunding-goal-by-14-5k\">crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise $30K. However, the team raised only <strong>45% of the $30,000</strong> funding goal.</p>\n<p>The team pressed on and released the first version back in January. Since then, the team has relied on funding from the <a href=\"http://versionpress.net/\">Early Access Program</a>. Borek Bernard, the lead developer of VersionPress, says the influx of cash will help fuel rapid development:</p>\n<blockquote><p>First and foremost, it means that we will be able to develop VersionPress at a more rapid pace. What we currently have in the <a href=\"http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/versionpress-2-0-released/\">recently released v2.0</a> is a great start but the vision and the technical challenge are just so large that this new fuel will is more than welcome. We have many cool features planned and this will allow us to deliver them in a timely manner.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The funding comes on the heels of <a href=\"http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/10/versionpress-2-0-released/\">VersionPress 2.0</a> which includes, database synchronization functionality and an updated user interface that is completely JavaScript based, along with a number of other features. In addition to funding, Bernard says talking to investors gives him a fresh perspective on the project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One big benefit of talking to investors is that it provides a fresh perspective on the problems one is trying to solve, how to solve them, for whom, etc. Speaking to them made us realize a couple of important things which will greatly benefit our users down the road.</p></blockquote>\n<p>VersionPress joins a growing list of WordPress products and services that have raised venture capital. In 2014, <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/coschedule-by-todaymade/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/coschedule-by-todaymade/\">CoSchedule</a>, the editorial workflow and activity scheduling plugin, <a title=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/coschedule-series-a-funding/\" href=\"http://coschedule.com/blog/coschedule-series-a-funding/\">secured $500K</a> in a Series A round of funding.

A complete customer list was given to Vimal and Williamson is no long providing support.</p>\n<p>When the opportunity presented itself to adopt a plugin created by Williamson, Vimal jumped on it, &#8220;Shortly after I saw his tweet, I quickly contacted Pippin. His work is something I’ve always looked up to. His work on plugins has inspired me to pursue the plugin/product market,&#8221; Vimal said.</p>\n<p>Licenses start at $10 for single sites, $20 for two to five sites, and $35 for an unlimited number of sites. Vimal says that he is working on a new version with changes in design, functionality, and more. The plugin will also receive its own dedicated site with a change in branding.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see what changes Vimal has in store for the plugin. Until then, existing customers from Pippinsplugins.com should watch their inbox for details on renewing their subscription to TechVoltz.com.</p>\n<div id=\"epoch-width-sniffer\"></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 23 Oct 2015 20:02:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.4 Beta 1 Released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=48687\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-4-beta-1-released\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4051:\"<p>After more than eight weeks in development, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2015/10/wordpress-4-4-beta-1/\">WordPress 4.4. beta 1 is available</a> for testing.

Scope of Agreement, acceptance, and changes</strong>\r\n\r\n1.1 Meemim’s Knowledge Management application and external applications and networks associated with Meemim plus other software, websites, and services that link to this Agreement are collectively known as the “Online Services” or simply as the “Services”.\r\n\r\n1.2 By using or accessing the Services, or by agreeing to these terms where the option is made available in the user interface, the Customer agrees to abide by this Agreement without any modification. If the Customer does not agree, the Services may not be used.\r\n\r\n1.3 Meemim may change or amend these terms. Customers will be notified of changes and amendments via an email message. If the Services are used after the date the change becomes effective, it will be interpreted that the Customer has consented to the changed terms. If the Customeer does not agree to the changes, then the Customer must stop using the\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Content</strong>\r\n\r\n2.1 The Services enable Customers to communicate with other Customers and to share or store various types of Content, such as, comments, files, photos, documents and videos. Meemim does not claim ownership of the Content posted or otherwise provided on the Services, except for material that is licensed to the Customer that may be incorporated into the Customer’s Content. The Customer is responsible for the Content posted to the Services. Customers may delete their own Content from the Services, so long as the Customer is still a user of the Services. For additional information, please contact the Meemim to better understand Content rights.\r\n\r\n2.2 The Customer initially controls who has access to their Content. Once Content is made public, the Customer agrees that anyone who has access to the public Content may, for free, use, save, reproduce, distribute, display and transmit that Content in connection with their use of the Services and other Meemim, or its licensees’, products and services. If a Customer does not want others to have this ability, then the Customer should not use the Services to share their Content. The Customer represents and warrants that for the duration of this Agreement the Customer has (and will have) all the rights necessary to the Content uploaded or shared on the Services and that the use of the Content, as contemplated in this Section 2.2, won’t violate any law.\r\n\r\n2.3 When Content is transmitted or uploaded to the Services, the Customer is giving Meemim the worldwide right, without charge, to use the Content as necessary: to provide the Services to the Customer, to protect the Customer, and to improve Meemim products and services. Meemim uses and protects the Content as outlined in the Meemim Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n2.4 In order to protect Customers and the Services, Meemimhas established this code of conduct (“Code of Conduct”) governing the use of the Services. Content or actions that violate the Code of Conduct or this Agreement are not permitted.\r\n\r\ni. Do not use the Services for illegal purposes.\r\n\r\nii. Do not engage in any activity that exploits, harms or threatens to harm children.\r\n\r\niii. Do not send spam or use an Account to help others send spam. Spam is unsolicited bulk email, postings or instant messages.\r\n\r\niv. Do not publicly display inappropriate images (e.g. nudity, bestiality, pornography).\r\n\r\nv. Do not engage in activity that is false or misleading (e.g. attempts to ask for money under false pretenses, impersonating someone else).\r\n\r\nvi. Do not engage in activity that is harmful to the Services or others (e.g. viruses, stalking, hate speech, advocating violence against others).\r\n\r\nvii. Do not infringe upon the rights of others (e.g. unauthorized sharing of copyrighted music, resale or other distribution of photographs and other Content).\r\n\r\nviii. Do not engage in activity that violates the privacy of others.\r\n\r\nix. Meemim will remove, limit distribution of, or disable access to Content if Meemim determines an action is in violation of this Agreement, complaints are received from another Customer, a notice is received of intellectual property infringement, or legal instructions are receveid to remove Content. Meemim may also block delivery of a communication (e.g. email, instant message) to or from the Services as part of Meemim’s effort to protect the Services, Meemim’s Customers, and the terms of this Agreement. Customers should back-up Content regularly.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Services cancellation</strong>\r\n\r\n3.1 If a Customer violates this Agreement, doesn’t meet the qualifications, or Meemim suspects fraud, there are a range of actions Meemim may take including removing Content from the Services, suspending or cancelling a Customer’s access to the Services, or referring such activity to appropriate authorities. Content that is deleted may be irretrievable.\r\n\r\n3.2 (1) Meemim may terminate the Services at any time for any reason, and (2) Meemim may modify or remove a Customer’s access at any time for any reason.\r\n\r\n3.3 A Customer may terminate the Services associated with theirAccount at any time and for any reason via profile settings, unless the owner of the Customer’s organizational domain has assumed control of the Account. In these cases, the Customer can ask Meemim to terminate the Account.\r\n\r\n3.4 If Services are canceled or terminated, the right to use the Services stops immediately and the Customer’s license to use the software related to the Services ends. Access to all posted Content may be terminated, but the Content may remain in the Services for as long as Meemim remain active. Meemim is under no obligation to notify a Customer or return Content to a Customer.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Privacy</strong>\r\n\r\nPrivacy is the highest importance to Meemim. Please refer to the Privacy Policy to see how Content and any information collected from the Customer is kept safe.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Services disruptions and backup</strong>\r\nMeemim strives to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages. Meemim is not liable for any disruption or loss suffered as a result.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Software and related Services</strong>\r\n\r\n6.1 Unless accompanied by a separate license agreement, any software provided by Meemim as part of the Services is subject to the terms of this Agreement. The software is licensed, not sold, and Meemim reserves all rights to the software not expressly granted by Meemim, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise. For example, if this Agreement governs the website being viewed, any third party scripts or code, linked to or referenced from this website, are licensed to the Customer by the third parties that own such code, not by Meemim.\r\n\r\n6.2 In addition to the other restrictions in this Agreement, a Customer may not: (i) circumvent or bypass any technological protection measures in or relating to the software or Services or disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any software or other aspect of the Services that is included in or accessible through the Services, except and only to the extent that the applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so; (ii) separate components of the software or Services for use on different devices; (iii) publish, copy, rent, lease, or lend the software or the Services; or (iv) transfer the software, any software licenses, or any rights to access or use the Services. Services cannot be used in any unauthorized way that could interfere with anyone else’s use of them or gain access to any service, data, Account or network. Access to the Services by unauthorized third-party applications is strictly forbidden.\r\n\r\n6.3 Meemim may automatically check a Customer’s version of the software. Meemim may also automatically download updates to the software from time to time. The Customer agrees to accept such updates subject to these terms unless other terms accompany the updates. If so, those other terms apply. Meemim isn’t obligated to make any updates available and doesn’t guarantee that Meemim will support the version of the system for which the software has been licensed.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. Class action waiver. </strong>\r\n\r\nAny proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither Customers nor Meemim will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or other proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. MEEMIM, AND OUR AFFILIATES, RESELLERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND VENDORS, MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO USE OF THE SERVICES. USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT A CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK AND THAT MEEMIM PROVIDES THE SERVICES ON AN “AS IS” BASIS “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” MEEMIM DOESN’T GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OR TIMELINESS OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM THE SERVICES. To the extent permitted under a Customer’s local law, Meemim excludes any implied warranties, including for merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, workmanlike effort, and non-infringement. You may have certain rights under your local law. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to affect those rights, if they are applicable.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>THE CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGEs THAT computer and telecommunications systems are not fault-free and occasional periods of downtime occur. Meemim does not guarantee the services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free or that CONTENT loss won’t occur.</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>9. Limitation of Liability</strong>\r\nIf Meemim breaches this Agreement, the Customer agrees that the Customer’s exclusive remedy is to recover, from Meemim or any affiliates, resellers, distributors, and vendors, direct damages up to USD$10.00. The Customer cannot recover any other damages OR LOSSES, including, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, incidental, or punitive. These limitations and exclusions apply if this remedy doesn’t fully compensate the Customer for any losses or fails of its essential purpose or if Meemim knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. To the maximum extent permitted by law, these limitations and exclusions apply to anything related to this Agreement such as loss of Content; any virus affecting use of the Services; delays or failures in starting or completing transmissions or transactions; claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, misrepresentation, omission, trespass, or other tort; violation of statute or regulation; or unjust enrichment. Some or all of these limitations or exclusions may not apply to the Customer if the Customer’s state, province, or country doesn’t allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. Third-party websites, non-Meemim products and third-party software components</strong>\r\n\r\n10.1 Third-Party websites. Third-party websites or services via the Services may be available to a Customer. Meemim isn’t responsible for third-party websites, services, or material available through those third-party services. The Customer is solely responsible for dealings with third parties (including advertisers). Use of third-party websites or services may be subject to that third party’s terms and conditions.\r\n\r\n10.2 Non-Meemim Products. Meemim may make non-Meemim products or services (“Non-Meemim Product”) available via the Services. If the Customer installs or uses any Non-Meemim Product with the Services, the Customer may not do so in any way that would subject Meemim’s intellectual property or technology to obligations beyond those expressly included in this Agreement. Meemim assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the Non-Meemim Product. The Customer is solely responsible for any Non-Meemim Product that is installed or used with the Services.\r\n\r\n10.3 Third-party Software Components. The software provided by Meemim as part of the Services may contain third party software components. Unless otherwise disclosed in that software, Meemim, not the third party, licenses these components to the Customer under Meemim’s license terms and notices.\r\n\r\n<strong>11. Survival</strong>\r\nThis Section, and Sections 1.3, 2.2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 25, and those that by their terms apply after it ends will survive any termination or cancellation of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n<strong>12. Assignment and transfer</strong>\r\nMeemim may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to the Customer. The Customer may not assign this Agreement or transfer any rights to use the Services.\r\n\r\n<strong>13. Consent to electronic notices provided by Meemim about the Service</strong>s\r\nThe Customer consents for Meemim to provide notifications about the Services or information the law requires Meemim to provide via email to the email address specified when the Customer signed up for the Services. Notices emailed to the Customer will be deemed given and received when the email is sent. If the Customer does not consent to receiving notices electronically, the Customer must stop using the Services.\r\n\r\n<strong>14. No third-party beneficiaries</strong>\r\nThis Agreement is solely for the Customer’s and Meemim’s benefit. It isn’t for the benefit of any other person, except for Meemim’s successors and assigns.\r\n\r\n<strong>15.

Content\r\n        2.1 The Services enable Customers to communicate with other Customers and to share or store various types of Content, such as, comments, files, photos, documents and videos. Meemim does not claim ownership of the Content posted or otherwise provided on the Services, except for material that is licensed to the Customer that may be incorporated into the Customer’s Content. The Customer is responsible for the Content posted to the Services. Customers may delete their own Content from the Services, so long as the Customer is still a user of the Services. For additional information, please contact the Meemim to better understand Content rights.\r\n        2.2 The Customer initially controls who has access to their Content. Once Content is made public, the Customer agrees that anyone who has access to the public Content may, for free, use, save, reproduce, distribute, display and transmit that Content in connection with their use of the Services and other Meemim, or its licensees’, products and services. If a Customer does not want others to have this ability, then the Customer should not use the Services to share their Content. The Customer represents and warrants that for the duration of this Agreement the Customer has (and will have) all the rights necessary to the Content uploaded or shared on the Services and that the use of the Content, as contemplated in this Section 2.2, won’t violate any law.\r\n        2.3 When Content is transmitted or uploaded to the Services, the Customer is giving Meemim the worldwide right, without charge, to use the Content as necessary: to provide the Services to the Customer, to protect the Customer, and to improve Meemim products and services. Meemim uses and protects the Content as outlined in the Meemim Privacy Policy.\r\n        2.4 In order to protect Customers and the Services, Meemimhas established this code of conduct (“Code of Conduct”) governing the use of the Services. Content or actions that violate the Code of Conduct or this Agreement are not permitted.\r\n        i. Do not use the Services for illegal purposes.\r\n        ii. Do not engage in any activity that exploits, harms or threatens to harm children.\r\n        iii. Do not send spam or use an Account to help others send spam. Spam is unsolicited bulk email, postings or instant messages.\r\n        iv. Do not publicly display inappropriate images (e.g. nudity, bestiality, pornography).\r\n        v. Do not engage in activity that is false or misleading (e.g. attempts to ask for money under false pretenses, impersonating someone else).\r\n        vi. Do not engage in activity that is harmful to the Services or others (e.g. viruses, stalking, hate speech, advocating violence against others).\r\n        vii. Do not infringe upon the rights of others (e.g. unauthorized sharing of copyrighted music, resale or other distribution of photographs and other Content).\r\n        viii. Do not engage in activity that violates the privacy of others.\r\n        ix. Meemim will remove, limit distribution of, or disable access to Content if Meemim determines an action is in violation of this Agreement, complaints are received from another Customer, a notice is received of intellectual property infringement, or legal instructions are receveid to remove Content. Meemim may also block delivery of a communication (e.g. email, instant message) to or from the Services as part of Meemim’s effort to protect the Services, Meemim’s Customers, and the terms of this Agreement. Customers should back-up Content regularly.\r\n    3. Services cancellation\r\n        3.1 If a Customer violates this Agreement, doesn’t meet the qualifications, or Meemim suspects fraud, there are a range of actions Meemim may take including removing Content from the Services, suspending or cancelling a Customer’s access to the Services, or referring such activity to appropriate authorities. Content that is deleted may be irretrievable.\r\n        3.2 (1) Meemim may terminate the Services at any time for any reason, and (2) Meemim may modify or remove a Customer’s access at any time for any reason.\r\n        3.3 A Customer may terminate the Services associated with theirAccount at any time and for any reason via profile settings, unless the owner of the Customer’s organizational domain has assumed control of the Account. In these cases, the Customer can ask Meemim to terminate the Account.\r\n        3.4 If Services are canceled or terminated, the right to use the Services stops immediately and the Customer’s license to use the software related to the Services ends. Access to all posted Content may be terminated, but the Content may remain in the Services for as long as Meemim remain active. Meemim is under no obligation to notify a Customer or return Content to a Customer.\r\n    4. Privacy\r\n    Privacy is the highest importance to Meemim. Please refer to the Privacy Policy to see how Content and any information collected from the Customer is kept safe.\r\n    5. Services disruptions and backup\r\n    Meemim strives to keep the Services up and running; however, all online services suffer occasional disruptions and outages. Meemim is not liable for any disruption or loss suffered as a result.\r\n    6. Software and related Services\r\n        6.1 Unless accompanied by a separate license agreement, any software provided by Meemim as part of the Services is subject to the terms of this Agreement. The software is licensed, not sold, and Meemim reserves all rights to the software not expressly granted by Meemim, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise. For example, if this Agreement governs the website being viewed, any third party scripts or code, linked to or referenced from this website, are licensed to the Customer by the third parties that own such code, not by Meemim.\r\n        6.2 In addition to the other restrictions in this Agreement, a Customer may not: (i) circumvent or bypass any technological protection measures in or relating to the software or Services or disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any software or other aspect of the Services that is included in or accessible through the Services, except and only to the extent that the applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so; (ii) separate components of the software or Services for use on different devices; (iii) publish, copy, rent, lease, or lend the software or the Services; or (iv) transfer the software, any software licenses, or any rights to access or use the Services. Services cannot be used in any unauthorized way that could interfere with anyone else’s use of them or gain access to any service, data, Account or network. Access to the Services by unauthorized third-party applications is strictly forbidden.\r\n        6.3 Meemim may automatically check a Customer’s version of the software. Meemim may also automatically download updates to the software from time to time. The Customer agrees to accept such updates subject to these terms unless other terms accompany the updates. If so, those other terms apply. Meemim isn’t obligated to make any updates available and doesn’t guarantee that Meemim will support the version of the system for which the software has been licensed.\r\n    7. Class action waiver. Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither Customers nor Meemim will seek to have any dispute heard as a class action, private attorney general action, or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or other proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.\r\n    8. MEEMIM, AND OUR AFFILIATES, RESELLERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND VENDORS, MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO USE OF THE SERVICES. USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT A CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK AND THAT MEEMIM PROVIDES THE SERVICES ON AN “AS IS” BASIS “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” MEEMIM DOESN’T GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OR TIMELINESS OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM THE SERVICES. To the extent permitted under a Customer’s local law, Meemim excludes any implied warranties, including for merchantability, satisfactory quality, fitness for a particular purpose, workmanlike effort, and non-infringement. You may have certain rights under your local law. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to affect those rights, if they are applicable.\r\n    THE CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGEs THAT computer and telecommunications systems are not fault-free and occasional periods of downtime occur. Meemim does not guarantee the services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free or that CONTENT loss won’t occur.\r\n    9. Limitation of Liability\r\n    If Meemim breaches this Agreement, the Customer agrees that the Customer’s exclusive remedy is to recover, from Meemim or any affiliates, resellers, distributors, and vendors, direct damages up to USD$10.00. The Customer cannot recover any other damages OR LOSSES, including, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, consequential, lost profits, special, indirect, incidental, or punitive. These limitations and exclusions apply if this remedy doesn’t fully compensate the Customer for any losses or fails of its essential purpose or if Meemim knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. To the maximum extent permitted by law, these limitations and exclusions apply to anything related to this Agreement such as loss of Content; any virus affecting use of the Services; delays or failures in starting or completing transmissions or transactions; claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, misrepresentation, omission, trespass, or other tort; violation of statute or regulation; or unjust enrichment. Some or all of these limitations or exclusions may not apply to the Customer if the Customer’s state, province, or country doesn’t allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.\r\n    10. Third-party websites, non-Meemim products and third-party software components\r\n        10.1 Third-Party websites. Third-party websites or services via the Services may be available to a Customer. Meemim isn’t responsible for third-party websites, services, or material available through those third-party services. The Customer is solely responsible for dealings with third parties (including advertisers). Use of third-party websites or services may be subject to that third party’s terms and conditions.\r\n        10.2 Non-Meemim Products. Meemim may make non-Meemim products or services (“Non-Meemim Product”) available via the Services. If the Customer installs or uses any Non-Meemim Product with the Services, the Customer may not do so in any way that would subject Meemim’s intellectual property or technology to obligations beyond those expressly included in this Agreement. Meemim assumes no responsibility or liability whatsoever for the Non-Meemim Product. The Customer is solely responsible for any Non-Meemim Product that is installed or used with the Services.\r\n        10.3 Third-party Software Components. The software provided by Meemim as part of the Services may contain third party software components. Unless otherwise disclosed in that software, Meemim, not the third party, licenses these components to the Customer under Meemim’s license terms and notices.\r\n    11. Survival\r\n    This Section, and Sections 1.3, 2.2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 25, and those that by their terms apply after it ends will survive any termination or cancellation of this Agreement.\r\n    12. Assignment and transfer\r\n    Meemim may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to the Customer. The Customer may not assign this Agreement or transfer any rights to use the Services.\r\n    13. Consent to electronic notices provided by Meemim about the Services\r\n    The Customer consents for Meemim to provide notifications about the Services or information the law requires Meemim to provide via email to the email address specified when the Customer signed up for the Services. Notices emailed to the Customer will be deemed given and received when the email is sent. If the Customer does not consent to receiving notices electronically, the Customer must stop using the Services.\r\n    14. No third-party beneficiaries\r\n    This Agreement is solely for the Customer’s and Meemim’s benefit. It isn’t for the benefit of any other person, except for Meemim’s successors and assigns.\r\n    15. Support\r\n    The Customer understands and agrees that Meemim is not obligated to provide the Customer any support concerning the use of the Services. However, if a Customer has a question about the Services, the Customer is encouraged to post a question on the Meemim Community Public Forum.\r\n    16. Waiver of non-competition provision\r\n    If the Customer is a direct competitor of the Services, the Customer is allowed to access and use the Services subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. By doing so, the Customer agrees to waive as against Meemim, its subsidiaries and its affiliated companies (including prospectively) any competitive use, access, and benchmarking test restrictions in the terms of use governing the Customer’s service offering to the extent that theterms of use are, or purport to be, more restrictive than Meemim’s terms. If the Customer does not waive any such purported restrictions in the terms of use governing their service, the Customer is not allowed to access or use the Services, and should not do so.\r\n    17. Copyright and trademark notices.\r\n    All portions of the Services are Copyright © 2015 Meemim Inc. and/or its suppliers. All rights reserved.\r\n    18.

For example, all users who sign up with a “contoso.com” email address would be part of the Contoso Meemim system. In addition, an Organization may invite users with different email domain names to their Meemim as “guest users” or as participants in external networks associated with that Meemim.\r\n','Terms and Conditions','','inherit','closed','closed','','26-revision-v1','','','2015-11-16 11:59:53','2015-11-16 11:59:53','',26,'http://localhost:8080/index.php/26-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(83,1,'2015-11-16 12:02:36','2015-11-16 12:02:36','<ol>\r\n	<li> Scope of Agreement, acceptance, and changes\r\n1.1 Meemim’s Knowledge Management application and external applications and networks associated with Meemim plus other software, websites, and services that link to this Agreement are collectively known as the “Online Services” or simply as the “Services”.\r\n1.2 By using or accessing the Services, or by agreeing to these terms where the option is made available in the user interface, the Customer agrees to abide by this Agreement without any modification.

Meemim will remove, limit distribution of, or disable access to Content if Meemim determines an action is in violation of this Agreement, complaints are received  from another Customer, a notice is received of intellectual property infringement, or legal instructions are receveid to remove Content. Meemim may also block delivery of a communication (e.g. email, instant message) to or from the Services as part of Meemim’s effort to protect the Services, Meemim’s Customers, and the terms of this Agreement.

Content that is deleted may be irretrievable.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            3.2 (1) Meemim may terminate the Services at any time for any reason, and (2) Meemim may modify or remove a Customer’s access at any time for any reason.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            3.3 A Customer may terminate the Services associated with theirAccount at any time and for any reason via profile settings, unless the owner of the Customer’s organizational domain has assumed control of the Account. In these cases, the Customer can ask Meemim to terminate the Account.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            3.4 If Services are canceled or terminated, the right to use the Services stops immediately and the Customer’s license to use the software related to the Services ends.

The software is licensed, not sold, and Meemim reserves all rights to the software not expressly granted by Meemim, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise. For example, if this Agreement governs the website being viewed, any third party scripts or code, linked to or referenced from this website, are licensed to the Customer by the third parties that own such code, not by Meemim.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            6.2 In addition to the other restrictions in this Agreement, a Customer may not: (i) circumvent or bypass any technological protection measures in or relating to the software or Services or disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any software or other aspect of the Services that is included in or accessible through the Services, except and only to the extent that the applicable copyright law expressly permits doing so; (ii) separate components of the software or Services for use on different devices; (iii) publish, copy, rent, lease, or lend the software or the Services; or (iv) transfer the software, any software licenses, or any rights to access or use the Services.

Class action waiver. </strong>\r\n\r\nAny proceedings to resolve or litigate any dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.
